					<li>The <em><strong>Introduction</em></strong> should clearly summarize the current understanding of the investigated issue (relevant research literature), briefly present the previous results and/or research shortcomings, state the purpose and the objectives of the research in the form of the hypothesis or research question(s), briefly explain the rationale and approach, the elements of originality and novelty, as well as the possible outcomes.     </li>
					<li><em><strong>Methods.</em></strong> This section should contain the description of the context and setting of the study, the research design, the explanation of the research methods and procedures used to carry out the research, what data and materials were used and how the data was analysed. Generally, it should offer enough information for the reader to understand and reproduce the research. </li>
					<li><em><strong>Results and Discussion.</em></strong> Authors may use different titles and subtitles for this section in compliance with their research purpose and objectives. However, this section must follow a logical structure, based on logical constructions. It should concisely and objectively present the results and explain the key findings with respect to the research question; it should discuss the main results with reference to previous research on the respective topic and outline the various implications of the results.</li>
					<li><em><strong>Conclusions</em></strong> should summarize and emphasize the answers to the research question(s) posed in the introduction and make clear how and why the results contribute to knowledge in the field (their significance for practice, theory, policy or further research). In addition, it should analyse the strengths and limitations of the study and indicate possible directions for future research. Conclusions MUST NOT BE a simple summary of the study or repeat the abstract.</li>
				</ul>

		<p align="justify" class="style10"><strong>Acknowledgments  </strong> are optional. Authors are encouraged to briefly acknowledge any significant help and assistance with designing or conducting the research, with writing and proofreading the manuscript, with materials, comments or financial support. Acknowledgements may be made to individuals, institutions, funding bodies, etc.</p>	

		<p align="justify" class="style10"><strong>References </strong> <em>(Times New Roman 11 pts., justified; Paragraph - Indentation - Special - Hanging by 1.25 cm) </br>
		Romanian Review of Regional Studies</em> follows a version of the Harvard citing and referencing style. </p>
		
				<ul style="list-style-type:square" align="justify" class="style10">
					<li><em><strong>In-text citations</em></strong></br> When citing sources in the text using this author-date referencing style, the author(s)/editor(s) family name is followed by the year of publication (in parentheses): (Popescu and Smith, 2015). For quotation or where a specific point in the cited reference is emphasized, authors are asked to write also the relevant page number(s): (Popescu, 2014, p. 5) or (Popescu, 2014, pp. 5-6).  </li>
					<li><em><strong>Reference list </em></strong></br> References at the end of the paper must contain an alphabetical listing of each reference actually cited in the body of the text. When a title is in language other than English, the translation into English must be provided between square brackets (see the RRRS Article Template below). </li>
				</ul>

		
		<p align="justify" class="style10"><strong>Appendices </strong> <em>(Times New Roman 10 or 11 pts., regular)  </em></br>
Appendices are optional In case additional materials (raw or processed data, extra photographs and maps) are considered essential to understanding the paper, appendices can be used to avoid burdening the main body of the text. Appendices must be numbered consecutively with Arabic numerals and must be referred to in the text as Appendix 1, Appendix 2, etc.     </p>
		<p align="justify" class="style10"><strong>3. FIGURES, TABLES AND FOOTNOTES </strong> </br>
In order to summarize data and visually illustrate the results and findings, figures and tables should be used.  </p>
		<p align="justify" class="style10"><strong>Illustrations </strong> (graphs, charts, maps, drawings, photographs) must be both inserted in text, in the appropriate place, and supplied in electronic version, in JPG or TIFF format, at no less than 300 dpi. Illustrations must be clear, precise and legible. Authors are asked to remove any unnecessary boxes, lines, explanations, etc. and keep in mind Edward R. Tufte's <em>Principles of Graphical Excellence</em> laid out in his book <em>The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</em> (2007, p. 51): </p>
				<ol  align="justify" class="style10">
					<li>Graphical excellence is the well-designed presentation of interesting data - a matter of substance, of statistics, and of design. </li>
					<li>Graphical excellence consists of complex ideas communicated with clarity, precision and efficiency. </li>
					<li>Graphical excellence is that which gives to the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest space. </li>
					<li>Graphical excellence is nearly always multivariate. </li>
					<li>And graphical excellence requires telling the truth.</li>
				</ol>
		<p align="justify" class="style10">All figures must be numbered consecutively using Arabic numerals and must be referred to in the text as Figure 1, Figure 2, etc. Figure titles must be provided as text, separated from the figure object itself, and must be placed under the illustrations. In case the figures or the information in the figures was taken from other sources, the source must be indicated under the figure. </p>
		<p align="justify" class="style10">Black and white colour or grey shading is preferred for the print version of the journal. However, a small number of colour figures are also accepted in case legibility is affected. Figures can be published in full colour in the online PDF version of the journal. For this reason, authors must ensure that in the case of colour figures, colours chosen will reproduce well when printed in black and white.</p>
		<p align="justify" class="style10"><strong>Tables</strong> must be numbered consecutively with Arabic numbers and must be referred to in the text as Table 1, Table 2, etc. They should not repeat data available elsewhere in the text or figures. Table titles must be provided as text and placed above the tables. In case the information in the tables was taken from other sources, the source must be indicated under the figure.</p>
		<p align="justify" class="style10"><strong>Footnotes  </strong><em>(Times New Roman 10 pts, regular, justified)  </em> </br>
Footnotes can be used for additional information or explanations.  </p>
