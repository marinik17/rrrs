            <strong>Theoretical Foundations for an Integrated  Assessment Framework in Landscape Research </strong><br />

            <strong>Abstract</strong><strong> - </strong>It is stated, that  ecological theories like the one of organizational levels in living systems, if  combined with a general systems approach, can be useful also for understanding  and manipulating social systems and its &ldquo;hidden socio-cybernetic processes&rdquo;.<br />
          Especially in relation to trans-level phenomena affecting different  organisational levels, different research approaches have to be introduced,  showing that descriptive-observational (which also means more holistic) and  quantitative-experimental (which also means more reductionistic) approaches are  complementary. Therefore, to include all relevant information in delineation  and description of systems at any integration level, a &rdquo;staircase&rdquo; or &rdquo;scaling&rdquo;  of research steps appears to be the most useful approach. This combines  comparative and quantitative research and is related to the various  organisational levels and, also, takes into account that there are continuous  transitions between observations and experiments, and between structures and  processes.<strong></strong><br />
          Landscape management, already traditional, deals with practical problems  and concepts for solutions. Hence, specific efforts like translating the  scientific models and indicators into models and indicators people can  understand as well as evaluation procedures of the scientific outcome into a  social and political context have to be provided. This approach is problem as  well as data and knowledge driven and similar to general systems approaches.<br />
          To conceptually overcome these gaps of interfaces for integration,  translation and communication between science and society we have worked out an  Environmental Impact Assessment Multi-level Approach. It is a combination of  the multi-level scaling and integration approach, and the environmental impact  assessment concept. <br />

            <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash; </strong>The paper outlines  the evolution of rural cultural landscapes in Poland against the background of  landscape classification. It defines cultural landscape types and subtypes,  based on several criteria of landscape classification, such as: genetic,  morphological, functional, and economic. A review of rural landscapes, based on  genetic criteria, considers the following historical periods: the primeval  community, the feudalism, the manorial system, the industrial revolution, the  interwar period of 1918 &ndash; 1939, the period of socialist economy, and market  economy. The processes that most significantly influenced the contemporary  shape of the rural landscape occurred just after the Second World War:  urbanization and industrialization, settlement in western and northern territories, as well as structural  and spatial transformations that took place after the year 1989 related to the  promotion of sustainable and multifunctional development of rural areas. </p>

            <strong>Abstract</strong> - This paper deals with some issues connected  with the determination of optimal land use in rural areas. A method of  Bajerowski was applied and two basic assumptions were made. The first  assumption was that it was possible, on the basis of a set of 56 selected  features, to initially determine the optimal function of a given rural area.  The second assumption was that the features selected and compiled in this set,  represented, sufficiently adequately, the impact of all other features regarded  essential for generating the optimal function of a given rural area. <br />
          The described concept  of optimal land use makes it possible to approach the methodology of  determining the optimal state/mode of land use as one of the elements and a  part of a study of conditions and trends in managing a rural gmina (commune). </p>
        <p><strong>Keywords: </strong>optimal land use, present use, and transformation.<br />

            <strong>Abstract -</strong><strong> </strong>The article  presents a systematic set of instruments for environment protection as the  background to describe major achievements Poland can boast of in the field of  environment protection. In the presented group of instruments for environment  protection, regulations, institutions and a financing system are concerned as  rudimentary since they constitute a legal, institutional, and economic basis  for environment protection. The achievements of environment protection in Poland  result both from the political transformations that took place after 1989 and  from a consistent application of environment protection instruments on all the  state managerial levels.</p>

            <strong>Abstract</strong> - The main goal in  the field of landscape management includes the protection and improvement of  landscapes&rsquo; condition and departing from their degradation. This goal is  included in the European Landscape Convention. Its aim is to care for  continent&rsquo;s landscapes through the processes such as identification,  evaluation, protection, management, and planning. The Convention is to apply to  all landscapes, not only to the landscapes of a unique value such as national  parks or to the landscapes that are on the List of World Heritage UNESCO.&nbsp; <br />
          The article includes the analysis of the Voivodeship&rsquo;s Program of  Malopolska Heritage and Cultural Landscape Protection from the point of view of  the Convention. Due to the fact that Poland has ratified this Convention,  certain responsibilities follow. On voivodeship&rsquo;s level, the Voivodeship&rsquo;s  Program should be recognized as a device to carry out the policy in the field  of landscape in accordance with Article 1 of the Convention. </p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT &nbsp;&ndash;</strong> This paper analyses one of the most  representative components of the rural religious material culture &ndash; the wooden  churches &ndash; typical for the historical province of Transylvania and especially  for Maramure&#351;. Wooden churches are specific for the rural space inhabited by  the Romanian communities, with an accented character of conservatism and  preservation of the traditions from Maramure&#351;, the Some&#351; Plateau and the Apuseni Mountains. The physiognomic architectural  characteristics and the technique of the buildings, joining the archaic means  with a science of equilibrium and of wood resistance have imposed this category  of objectives, offering originality and even uniqueness to the rural landscape  to which they belong.</p>

          ABSTRACT &ndash; Hungary,  belonging more and more to the prestigious group of developed countries, can be  characterised increasingly by the demographic characteristics of that type.  Ageing population, decreasing number of live births, decreasing population size  are commonly used terms when analysing the demographic profile of our country.  This simplified picture can be modulated and coloured with the help of spatial  data. In spite of the comparatively small-sized and relatively homogenous  structure of Hungary,  several differences can be found. The network of small towns could be an  obvious and representative sample for the spatial investigations since it  almost totally covers the area of Hungary, it is numerous enough but  still easy to handle. Within a Hungarian geographical context, settlements  having a maximum of 30,000 inhabitants and possessing city rank can be defined  as small towns. Because of their size and functions, small towns are sensitive  enough to illustrate the national demographic tendencies, but they are numerous  enough to be split into different groups according to their remarkably diverse  character. Traditional historic small towns widely differ from the ones located  in the rapidly urbanising agglomerations, even though the socialist new towns,  having similar origin, reflect significant demographic variants.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash;</strong> The geographical  space of Trasc&#259;u Mountains  is made up by a series of longitudinal ranges, corridors and plateaus, which  are named according to their position within the analysed region: the Western  Corridor, the Western Plateau, the Central Corridor, the Central Range,  the Eastern Plateau and the Eastern contact area or border. The valleys  crossing these longitudinal units create beautiful gorges between depression  areas. Most settlements are small and very small, lying along the corridors or  the valleys, but some are scattered on the hills. Their importance increases  eastwards. Their economic function is changing, from forestry and breeding  towards agriculture. The polarizing flows are organized along the main rivers,  but there is a need of improving the infrastructure. A model of the Trasc&#259;u Mountains is presented, and several  proposals are made to take the region out of isolation.</p>

            <strong>Abstract &ndash;</strong> The transformations that have affected  the region of the Apuseni Mountains after 1990, have determined a precarious  economic and social status in the mining areas, a fact officially recognized  through the delimitation of some &ldquo;disfavoured zones&rdquo;. The Apuseni Mountains  are also a region with a very rich touristic potential, which led to the  development of tourism in some of its parts. Yet, spatially, the two types of  areas (disfavoured and touristic) do not overlap. Functionally, two different  systems manifest themselves, separated by the Arie&#351; Valley  and the planned development strategies tend to emphasize the already-appeared  differences. </p>
        <p><strong>Key words:</strong> the Apuseni Mountains, disfavoured zone, tourism, spatial disparities. </p>
