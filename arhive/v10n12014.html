    <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash; </strong>Unlike other countries belonging to the  European Community, where the territorial grid was arranged in the matrix  provided by the territorial units for statistics (NUTS) on five distinct hierarchical  levels: macro-regions, regions, departments (districts), intercommunity  associations (microregions) and communes, in Romania, we currently operate only  with taxa 1, 3 and 5; regions and microregions are non-existent from the legal  point of view. If regions are now put into question at various levels,  microregions are still left at the will of ad-hoc initiatives. Hence, numerous  confusions and distortions occur in the absence of their clearly defined  status. The present paper reviews a series of situations in which the subject  has been debated and the scientific framework in which it should be  addressed.&nbsp; </p>

    <strong>ABSTRACT </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>During  the socialist era, a significant developmental slope was settled along the Hungarian-Romanian  border region, which separated a relatively more advanced Hungarian side from a  backward Romanian one. Using a quantitative methodology, we try to identify the  current territorial disparities on a lower spatial scale &ndash; namely on the level of  communities &ndash; in order to highlight the presumably lagging-behind status of a  narrower border strip. According to our hypothesis, this peripheral strip has a  disadvantageous status mainly because of its increased isolation. The factorial  analysis confirmed this fact on the Hungarian side; however, it was disproved  on the Romanian side because of the presence of large cities and basic  infrastructure networks on the proximity of the border.<strong></strong></p>

    <strong>ABSTRACT </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>This research was conducted in two villages in the  Yogyakarta-Surakarta Corridor, namely Maguwoharjo, Sleman Regency, and  Jatirejo, Boyolali Regency. The purpose of this study was: (1) to compare the  intensity of the regional transformation in both villages located in the  Yogyakarta-Surakarta Corridor during the period of 1990-2011, and (2) to  determine the role of both Yogyakarta and Surakarta as the mother cities in the  Yogyakarta-Surakarta Corridor in determining the regional transformation in  both villages. This research used a survey method based on both secondary  (Podes, 1990-2011) and primary data. In order to assess the role of Yogyakarta  and Surakarta in affecting the intensity of the regional transformation in both  research areas, qualitative-descriptive analysis was conducted based on field  observations and in-depth interviews. The results showed that the intensity of  the regional transformation of Maguwoharjo, as measured by four variables:  population density, population growth, the percentage of non-agricultural  household, and the percentage of built-up area, is higher than that of  Jatirejo. This research also found that the role of Yogyakarta City in intensifying  the regional transformation of Maguwoharjo is greater than the role of  Surakarta City in intensifying the regional transformation of Jatirejo.</p>

  <strong>Formal and Informal Planning  Instruments as Catalyst for Urban Attractiveness. Enhancing Town Attractiveness  in the Land of Beiu&#351;, Romania </strong><br />

    <strong>ABSTRACT  &ndash;</strong> We are once again witnessing a directional change in  urban studies. This simple and concise statement comes out from a brief  analysis of both the latest interests of different scholars and the discourses  of urban, regional, and governmental actors. The change we are talking about  refers to a slight interest drop in environmental issues and an ever-increasing  attention paid to the economic and social aspects of urban life. The conceptual  shift from <em>sustainable development </em>to <em>smart growth </em>is a good example, and  the fact that the recent European Union papers (EU 2020 strategy, EU Cohesion  Policy 2014-2020) have adopted it ensures its liability. Coming to urban  planning, which is primarily conceived as sets of regulatory measures, one can  notice that in order to achieve the latest standards it has to develop and  implement new methods and instruments which will eventually lead to <em>smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.</em> Knowing that urban plans look to specific urban issues as zoning, layout and  design, which are usually regulated by legally approved national guidelines,  this new tasks fall into the charge of informal planning. In Romania, informal  planning refers to <em>local development  strategies, local action plans </em>as well as the <em>Local Agenda 21</em>, which was implemented throughout the world<em>.</em> Admitting that municipalities  worldwide are in a sharp competition for inhabitants, investors and capital  (from trade, tourism, exhibitions, etc.), we realize that small and medium-sized  towns have to ensure that all of their valuable characteristics are as visible  and as marketable as possible. In order to do this, they have to enhance their  attractiveness through different actions, using different methods and  instruments. The present paper highlights the ways that local actors in four  small cities in Bihor County, Romania are trying to market their  municipalities. The chosen cities organically fit into one of the most  representative mental space in Romania, the Land of Beiu&#351;. The Romanian lands  are distinct areas, with high identical features, somehow isolated, hence in  need for suitable management measures. The paper&rsquo;s outline consists in an  empirical attractiveness measurement of two of the four towns, what are the  actual measures that local stakeholders are using to enhance their town  attractiveness and finally some recommendations based on examples of good  practices and successful stories from abroad.</p>

    <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash; </strong>Growth points are centres of economic activity,  which are artificially created or stimulated in disadvantaged regions with the  intention that they will eventually become natural centres of economic growth.  They are centres of expanding industries, which trigger a chain reaction of  production and promotion of associated services with the ultimate goal of  improving the quality of life. It is envisaged that by declaring promising and  resource-endowed centres as growth points, the cumulative causation process  would kick-start the process of economic development, whose spread effects  would activate the quality of life in the periphery. In so doing it would  attract investment and favourable government treatment, which would lead to  both cumulative growth in economic activity and high population growth. Some  growth poles have continued to prosper long after the initial stimulation  factor gone through multiplier effects associated with a growing centre. In  this paper, an attempt has been made to find out the potentialities of urban  centres of North 24 Parganas district of West Bengal, India as growth pole and  strategies for the regional development.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

    <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> - Impedance is, in territorial statistics, the  greater or lesser difficulty of a territory to be served/provided with adequate  infrastructure and related services, useful for the improvement of the  resident&rsquo;s quality of life. In the opposite, a greater impedance implies a low  attractiveness of the territory for the establishment of new productive  activities. The purpose of this research is to provide a picture as  comprehensive as possible of the existing methodology for the elaboration of  impedance, providing practical applications in relation to the Tuscan  territory. The methodology used in this paper is part of the category of models  called &ldquo;gravitational&rdquo;, which are characterized by the denominator of the  equation (index) that expresses the impediment in relation to accessibility  between points in geographic space. In this case, the calculations have been  made considering the cost of travel, which depends on the distance or travel  time between points located on the transportation network that represent the  points of departure and arrival. The processing affect the function of  impedance by elaborating linear, exponential and logistic forms for the  infrastructures related to hospitals with emergency rooms, upper secondary  schools, airports, and railway stations. Processing separately covered the  metropolitan municipality of Florence. The research highlights the main  existing methodologies in relation to determining accessibility  (attractiveness) of the territories, according to their infrastructural  facilities and services. The analysis reveals the strengths and weaknesses, as  well as the salient features of the equation used. In this sense, the research  has produced a real benchmark between different approaches, using from time to  time the variation of the impedance function.<strong></strong></p>

    <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash;</strong> Our present paper proposes to give  snapshot views on the status-quo of the Romanian economy at the level of  development regions. From a methodological perspective, the study is based on  the construction of an aggregated national Input-Output table from the more  detailed one of the National Institute of Statistics, followed by the  derivation of regional tables using the non-survey GRIT technique. Quantitative  sectoral interrelationships are going to be analysed based on multipliers,  backward and forward linkages in order to identify key sectors within regional  economies. This could serve as a baseline for assessing the impact of several  policies of the European Union on the Romanian economy, such as the Cohesion  Policy and the Common Agricultural Policy. The lower territorial approach &ndash;  i.e. the construction of regional Input-Output models &ndash; used within the present  study is in accordance with the European Union&rsquo;s NUTS2 level policy design and  planning philosophy on the one hand. On the other hand, this analytic direction  makes possible the use of the results as a base for regional economic  development strategy design, highlighting structural specificities and  discrepancies among regions of the same country. </p>

    <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> &ndash; Relocation of business service  offshoring-related activities measured by foreign direct investments and  exports in services have grown rapidly after the Millennium in the new EU  member states of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). Besides Foreign Direct  Investment (FDI), trade statistics support the assumption that an expanding  export in business and in ICT services has been associated with relocation of  shared services centres created by FDI in the six new member states (NMS). The  service export data collected between 1996/2002 and 2012 gives a good proxy to  identify those segments of service trade, which are considered to be  offshorable. The paper examines the additional location factors selecting  Central and Eastern European locations and summarises the effect of crisis on  this industry. It concludes that the sector has demonstrated market resilience  in the NMS and continued to expand rapidly.<br />

    <strong>ABSTRACT </strong>&ndash; In Italy, there has been a significant  emigration from the countryside towards urban areas with negative downsides on  rural communities which have suffered of socio-economic marginalization and  negative effects on the environment. The Common Agricultural Policy has been a  pivotal tool able to reduce the marginalization in rural territories financing  farmers able to promote the multifunctionality and the production of positive  externalities. By using a quantitative approach on Farm Accounting Data Network  time series on Italian farmers, it has been possible to access the role of  subsidies allocated by the European Union on the rural development. The results  have pointed out a positive role of financial supports and subsidies allocated  by the Common Agricultural Policy to guarantee an adequate level of farm  income. In the next period 2014-2020, the national and local authorities should  take into account to put into action the Rural Development Programme aimed to  implement the socio-economic growth in the Italian countryside specifically  towards farms located in less favoured areas. </p>

    <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash;</strong> The present paper aims to analyze the  socio-economic differences from the rural space of the South-West Oltenia  Development Region, and, in the same time, to make a correlation between the  level of development and the natural background (the relief) where the rural  settlements have developed along the history. In the same time, the long-term  development potential of the region is analysed, depending on the natural and  human resources available and depending on the outputs and inputs that take  place between the urban settlements and the rural space from the nearby area.  The proximity to the urban influence area can be a major factor with impact on  the access of the rural population to certain services, determining a higher  level of development. Also, an analysis of the poverty level was made, which  characterizes most part of the rural settlements (especially the isolated areas  or with aged population), by using statistical data from the National Institute  of Statistics and a series of indicators characteristic for the level of  development, correlated with the activity profile of the respective  settlements. This analysis was performed for a better identification of the  problems existent in the rural area of the South-West Oltenia Development Region  in order to offer some viable development solutions that are concentrated  especially on the natural resources and the local possibilities of the region.</p>

    <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash;</strong> In present times, in order to prosper and have  a raised standard of living, human society needs a stable and healthy  environment. Often, humans are not aware of the state or the evolution of the  environmental components. To obtain an objective image and to be able to  coordinate its daily activities, humans must identify and evaluate the sources  of natural environmental risks. These processes of identification and  evaluation offer the information needed in decision-taking and implementing  risk management methods. For a pertinent evaluation of natural environmental  risks and of the quality of the environment, this action has to be  interdisciplinary, based on a complex system of investigation methods,  procedures, techniques, feasible principles, and instruments. </p>

    <strong>ABSTRACT - </strong>The present paper aims to describe the role  that decision makers and inhabitants have in the evolution of the built  heritage from the regional system of the Land of Dorna. In order to achieve  this goal I analyzed and systematized all data and information relevant for  this study. Data from different sources provided by literature and from the field  research led to the identification of the local characteristics of the regional  system. The analysis has revealed a number of inconsistencies between an  optimal situation of a territorial system and the current state of the Land of  Dorna system in which a number of monuments lie in an advanced state of decay.  The improper management of the built heritage of the Land of Dorna by the local  actors has led to a series of territorial dysfunctions. The conclusions of this  paper have highlighted the urgent need to implement a series of measures aimed  to revitalize the built heritage in the Land of Dorna.</p>
