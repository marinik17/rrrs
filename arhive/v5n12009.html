            <strong>ABSTRACT - </strong>The geospatial absorptions are  characterized by a specific complexity both in content and in their  phenomenological and spatial manifestation fields. Such processes are  differentiated according to their specificity to pre-absorption, absorption or  post-absorption. The mechanisms that contribute to absorption are extremely  numerous: aggregation, extension, diffusion, substitution, resistivity  (resilience), stratification, borrowings, etc. Between these mechanisms  frequent relations are established determining an amplification of the process  and of its regional effects. The installation of the geographic osmosis  phenomenon in a given territory (a place for example) leads to a homogenization  of the geospatial state and to the installation of the regional homogeneity. </p>
        <p><strong>Keywords: </strong>geospatial absorption,<strong> </strong>absorption phase,<strong> </strong>mechanisms, territorial effects.<br />

            <strong>ABSTRACT - </strong>The paper presents  how economic structural changes affect a region&rsquo;s economic growth and  development. To show this effect is not that easy since changes of economic  structure take time, and the result of changes appear shifted in time in the  examined regions. Researchers examining reasons of income disparities among  countries pay attention to the question how differences of GDP levels and  growth rates can be explained by the economic structures. Literature of  economic development sets store by explanatory potential of differences in  macro-structures in countries within especially for share of agriculture in  gross domestic product. </p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> &ndash; The Some&#351; Plateau, situated  in the North - North-Western part of the Transylvanian Depression, represents  one of the most controversial geographical units as its extension and subunits  are concerned. The causes of this aspect are contained in the lithological,  morphological, and structural-tectonic differences present in the northern part  of the Transylvanian tectonic basin, as well as in the orientation of the  spatial interrelation vectors and of their gravitation towards corridors, axes,  or polarizing centres, defining for a functional territorial system. The  critical analysis of the predecessors&rsquo; opinions leads us towards the  individualization of the morphologic nucleus of the Some&#351; Plateau, consisting  of the Cluj and Dej Hills, as well as the &#350;imi&#351;na Hills, in the arc of the  circle shaped by the corridors of the Nad&#259;&#351; (C&#259;pu&#351;) &ndash; Some&#351;ul Mic &ndash; Some&#351;  rivers, to which a trans-Some&#351; compartment is attached, made of the  Purc&#259;re&#355;-Boiu Mare Plateau and the S&#259;l&#259;truc Hills. All these subunits gravitate,  naturally and anthropically, towards the above-mentioned river corridor,  forming a systemic type functional unit. </p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> - I wish to contribute to the spatial  analysis of Europe focusing on the Visegrad  Four countries. This paper deals with the economic development of NUTS 2  regions of the named Central European states during the interval 1995-2005.  At first, I have given a brief  overview of the theories regarding the relationship between the development and  territorial inequalities. Thereafter, I have investigated the changes of  regional disparities by countries and in time. For a better understanding of  the different regional performances, I have grouped the different territories  based on the population density and on the economic division. I aimed at  proving the existence of the &ldquo;trade off&rdquo; phenomenon concerning the regional  development; and the changing of the &ldquo;west-east incline&rdquo;. Finally, I have drawn a conclusion from the outcomes of the analysis.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> &ndash;After determining the development index at  commune level, we have managed to sketch 4 advantaged areas and 3 disadvantaged  ones. The most advantaged area is individualized around the county seat Baia  Mare, the rest of the advantaged areas revolving around Sighetu-Marma&#355;iei,  Bor&#351;a-Vi&#351;eu and T&acirc;rgu Lapu&#351; towns. The disadvantaged areas correspond mostly  with the rural settlements situated afar from the high-polarizing centers at  the county level (Baia Mare and Sighetu-Marma&#355;iei). This study reiterates the  enormous discrepancy between the rural and urban areas, but also between the  county seat city and all the other urban settlements. Maramure&#351; County is  situated somewhere at the lowest point in the counties hierarchy, not only  because of its limited extension and of the precarious condition of the  physical and social infrastructure, but also because of the chronic lack of  investment in this area. Economically, Maramure&#351; is characterized by a  domination of the population employed in agriculture (the number of which has  grown between the years 1990 and 2007, from 5% to 38%), in conjunction with a  decrease in the number of population employed in the secondary sector (from 60%  to 27%).</p>

  <strong>The Impact of Mining Activity upon  the Aquatic Environment in the Southern Apuseni Mountains&nbsp; </strong><br />

            <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> <strong>-</strong> In the Southern Apuseni Mountains, mining activities have taken  place since Antiquity, leaving their marks upon the natural environment, the  aquatic one inclusively. If the traditional technologies had a low impact upon  the aquatic environment, the ones in the modern period have affected it up to  the &ldquo;dead water&rdquo; level. It is about the disorganization of the hydrographical  basins and especially about aggressive pollution of surface waters with some of  the most toxic chemical substances such as cyanides, as well as by an increase  in the contents of metallic ions, chlorides, sulphides,  sulphates, suspensions and fixed residuum. The decrease in pH, and  implicitly the acidification of waters, is also remarkable. <br />
          It must be mentioned that no systematic studies of the impact of mining  activities upon the aquatic environment have been conducted in the area in the  last years. In these conditions, the data about water quality have been taken  over from the studies conducted by author between 1996 and 1998. The cause of  the lack of concern in the field is no other but the cease  in ore valorization activities in the majority of the mining objectives  in the area. As none of the tailings settling ponds has guard canals, the  direct pluvial waters and the ones drained from  the slopes transport tailings with noxes which they subsequently discharge  in the local pluvial network. In these conditions, both the quality of the mine  waters which run freely into the emissary and of the ones that flow from the  waste dumps remain mainly in the qualitative parameters analyzed and presented  in the study.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> - The study of regional underdevelopment has been,  during the last few decades, the main issue in fields such sociology and  economic sciences that have mainly used subjective approaches and research  methods, such as surveys and queries. By using integrated mathematical coefficients  and a comprehensible transparent map base, the main interest of the present  paper is to reconcile the methods and instruments of modern-day geography with  the classical methods of social sciences, finally proving that underdevelopment  is a geographically-induced phenomenon, as well as creating new geographies  itself.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash; </strong>&ldquo;<em>The Land of the Mo&#355;i</em>&rdquo; is a regional geographical  entity where the impact of the anthropic component is essential. If, for a long  period, the population has been a cohesion factor in the birth of this regional  system, at present, by means of the negative features of the demographical  indicators, the population stands out by inducing several elements of high risk.  The massive emigration of the population, especially from the areas of high  altitude, the gentrification process, the low degree of economic development,  are all serious problems which must be on the agenda of the decision-making  political factors.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT -</strong> The present study proposes a  systemic analysis which will determine the structure of inequalities,  medical-sanitary disparities in the North-West Development Region. The  methodological focus of our study falls on the medical-sanitary resources with  a higher interest on the medical-sanitary infrastructure of this regional  space. In order to highlight the &ldquo;map&rdquo; of the medical-sanitary disparities in  the North-West Development Region we have operated an inventory of  medical-sanitary resources and a demographical-based evaluation, thus coming to  an outcome of a quantity-quality complex analysis.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> &ndash; The present paper aims at identifying the disparities in  the spatial distribution of financial intermediaries by taking as case-study a  specific territorial unit, namely Cluj County. The knowledge of the number and  location of financial intermediaries has importance in understanding the  complex functionality of the territory, as well as in the complex process of  territorial management, since there is a close linkage between the presence and  the activity of the different financial institutions and economic and social  development. The analysis is focused on the following financial intermediaries:  monetary financial institutions, other financial  intermediaries, insurance companies and pension funds. The interpreted data,  the calculated indicators (such as the number of banks per 1,000 inhabitants,  the number of ATMs per 1,000 inhabitants) and the cartographic materials  indicate a high concentration of financial intermediaries in Cluj-Napoca, a  slight diversity in the other five towns of the county and low presence or even  their absence in rural area.</p>
        <p><strong>Keywords</strong>: spatial disparity, financial intermediary, Cluj  County.</p>
