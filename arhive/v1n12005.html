  <strong>Eco-Balancing as a  Guideline for Environmentally Sound Regional Planning Supported by GIS  Applications </strong><br />
  <strong>ROMAN J. M. LENZ</strong><br />
  <em>Pages 5-12</em></p>
    <p class="style12"><a href="Artpdf/v1n12005/RRRS011200502.pdf" target="_blank">[Full text]</a><br />
            <strong>ABSTRACT - </strong>During the last several years, environmental impact  assessment, regional or spatial planning, and environmental balancing seem to  develop similarities, e.g. joint basic methodological approaches such as the  use of environmental indicators, the focus on same environmental goods such  air, water, soil, flora/fauna, etc. (Lenz 1999). Especially GIS-based software  systems show their multiple applications in these fields.<br />
          After a short  introduction about the central role of indicators in transdisciplinary problem  solving processes, experiences from a set of regional environmental (or eco)  balances show a wide range of advantages as well as disadvantages in the  context of the widespread use of GIS-based planning tools. Relying on concepts  and examples for the spatial eco-balances in the district of Pfaffenhofen  (Upper Bavaria, Germany; cf. Lenz 1997) and the municipality of Mulfingen  (Hohenlohe, Germany) - both of them related to the concept of environmental  indicators of the Advisory Board of Environmental Affairs of the Federal  Republic of Germany (SRU 1994) and the Federal Environmental Agency (UBA 1995)  - we can show GIS-based information systems of a high practical relevancy. On  the basis of the GIS software ArcView, the data base management system Access,  and html scripts, we developed environmental information systems to balance  environmental effects in a map scale of 1:5,000 - 1:50,000, in order to provide  the administration with tools for an environmentally sound and sustainable  development of their area (Lenz 1997, 1999, Beuttler et al. 1999). The spatial  distribution of land use types, solar energy potential, area consumption and  drinking water consumption for the municipality   of Mulfingen are  highlighted in this paper. Still, the practical use of the systems seems to be  limited due to the lack of computer skills among the administrators &ndash; even  after programming graphical user interfaces for the indicator &ldquo;drinking water  consumption&rdquo;-, as well as due to widely distributed and hard-to-access data and  information sources.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> - After browsing the  principal terms of geographical regions like structural and functional regions,  the paper highlights the term &ldquo;cultural region&rdquo; as a manifestation of a certain  culture in the landscape on the one hand and as a factor of shaping cultural  identity on the other. The very point and message of the paper is to emphasize  that it was an advantage, if administrative regions, i.e. a subtype of  functional regions, would coincide with cultural regions, i.e. a subtype of  structural regions. It offers several explanations for why this coincidence was  favourable, hints at successful historical examples and recent attempts to  achieve such a coincidence.<br />

            <strong>ABSTRACT - </strong>The term &ldquo;&#354;ara Mo&#355;ilor&ldquo; is  very frequently used in the context of the planned gold mining project in Ro&#351;ia  Montan&#259;. The term is as well used in an economic and ecologic way and it is  used by those who support the project as well as by its critics. There are a  lot of articles in Romanian newspapers and brochures of the last three years  combining the gold mining project and the &#354;ara  Mo&#355;ilor topic. It will be analyzed in what different contexts the geographical  term is used and the spatial image of &#354;ara  Mo&#355;ilor that is produced in the respective context. Starting with a look into  the history of instrumentality of the region it is obvious that there exists a  long tradition in using this term for a strong mentality of people who defend  their freedom. In an actual context the every day communication of the local  population is reproducing this stereotype. The results of a questionnaire shows  that the stereotypes used by developer and opponents of the gold mining project  met with a strong response. By this way the production and reproduction of a  spatial image called &ldquo;&#354;ara Mo&#355;ilor&ldquo; can be  used successfully for the interests of the actors of both sides. But there  exists a geographical differentiation on a small scale between mining and  silvicultural areas. </p>

          The DKMT-Euroregion: An Instrument for Cross Border  Regional Development <br />
  <strong>HANS-HEINRICH RIESER</strong><br />

            <strong>ABSTRACT  -</strong> Up to now border regions of  national states have been and still are characterized by &ldquo;ends&rdquo;: the end of  traffic and communication infrastructures, the end of national laws and  mentalities. They have been part of the peripheral space surrounding the centre  or the centres of national states. Borders have been and partly still are lines  of more or less strict separation between one state and another, between one  people and another. <br />
          Encouraged by the  increasing cooperation between the &ldquo;centres&rdquo; after World War II, border regions  seek to change their bad situation caused, on both sides, by their separating  border line, through cooperation across these lines. Initially represented by  personal contacts, soon cooperation came to take institutional forms that would  stimulate it. The most accepted of cross border cooperation becomes the  &ldquo;Euroregion.&rdquo; Usually Euroregions are associations of neighbouring local or  regional administrative units on the borderlines of two or three, rarely more  than three states.<br />
          Since 1957 when the  so-called &ldquo;Euregio&rdquo; was founded on the German-Dutch border, these Euroregions  have aimed at improving the welfare of the people on both sides of the border.  One of the most effective ways to reach this aim is the holistic method of  regional development. This means making use of the whole regional potential in  a sustainable way for the people living in the region. <br />
          Therefore, all Euroregions &ndash; beside their differences in size or  organization &ndash; have common projects for cross border regional development.  Slowly, Euroregions have been acknowledged as suitable instruments for cross  border regional development.<br />
          Soon after 1989 Euroregions appeared, by transfer and attraction, in the  former widely isolated countries in Eastern Europe.  One of the dozens of Euroregions now existing in this area is the  DKMT-Euroregion, the &ldquo;Danube-K&ouml;r&ouml;s-Maros-Tisza-Euroregion&rdquo; between Serbia, Hungary,  and Romania.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT -</strong> The development of  metropolitan areas represents the main characteristic of today&rsquo;s urban  evolution trends. The first initiatives to delimitate and define metropolitan  areas have been in the United    States since 1910. In Europe, this concept  was adopted at the beginning of the1990s when the United States had already had 250  metropolitan areas. Romania  adopted the concept of metropolitan area in the late 1990s, namely in 1997 when  a study on the Directions, Ways, and Intensities of Development in the Municipality of Bucharest and its Metropolitan Zone.  Environmental protection politics appeared. This made public a point of view  about the Bucharest  metropolitan area, which was legally defined by Law no. 351 of July 6th  2001 regarding the National Territory Management Plan, Section IV &ndash;  Settlements. But many other limits of this area were also taken into account.  The uncontrolled evolution of the Bucharest Metropolitan Area as well as of  many other European capital cities can be stopped or stabilized by developing  green belts or green areas. </p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT  - </strong>Regionalisation as a process and regions as  territorial entities reappeared in the political, economic, administrative, and  scientific discourse. In Romania,  even since the Middle Ages, there have been regional type entities called  &ldquo;&#355;&#259;ri&rdquo;/ &ldquo;countries.&rdquo; They covered areas of approximately 400 km&sup2;. These regions  have remained as such until nowadays and therefore, they are irrefutable  territorial proofs of the continuity of the Romanian people in the area. The  territorial and administrative divisions that appeared later were the result of  the effort to keep pace with the necessity to modernize the society and with  the consequences of different historical events. <br />
          The present eight development regions in Romania try to emulate the territorial realities  that had occurred earlier in Western Europe.  The Romanian regions emerged from the need to fit the statistical requirements  of the rank 2 NUTS regions, but they are not functional.<br />
          The same thing is true about Euroregions,  which, in fact, have a rather cartographic functionality,  the normal territorial relationships being obstructed by the frontier effect.  This effect has increased lately because visas have again become compulsory for  some of the would-be partners in the co-operation on which the construction of  these regions relies. </p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT - </strong>This paper relies on the concept of  &ldquo;resilience&rdquo; understood as &ldquo;the ability of a system to adapt and persist,&rdquo; and  it uses, for the first time, this feature in the study of the geographical  region &ndash; a territorial system of great complexity. The factors relating to the  geographical region&rsquo;s resilience are climate changes, resource management,  anthropic pressure, interregional competition, the new development strategies,  and globalization.<br />

            <strong>ABSTRACT - </strong>A  short etymological interpretation of the notion of regions (Rette Lineatte,  etc.). The region is: R= f (S+P), where S is space and P is power. There  follows an evaluation of the characteristics of the region and the presentation  of different approaches to the region. From the classic ideas (von Humboldt,  1885, Dokuceaev, 1899, Herbertson, 1905, and others) we get to a wide  interpretative array of what we accept as organizational spatial units of  geographical reality. The environmental region has important connotations with  regard to the system as a surrounded element (man, society) and the adjacent  system. Critical environmental regions are areas where there already  exists&nbsp;&nbsp; interactive degradation. The  critical character may be physical, hence the &ldquo;geocritical regions&rdquo; or the  result of human impact, hence the &ldquo;anthropocritical regions.&rdquo; Critical  situations are differentiated at the local, regional, and global level. In  order to understand critical regional situations we must refer to the following  characteristics: fragility, resilience, and vulnerability.  Still there are few environmental studies on critical regions and work must be  done in this field.<br />

            <strong>ABSTRACT - </strong>Tourist  arrangements, the consumption of the tourist product, tourist demand are  spatially and geographically structured and they lead to specific types and  forms of tourism. The tourist and geographical regions have different  potentials or a specialized potential. These regions are to be found at the  contact between territorial units with mutual polarization and where there are double  or multiple functional junctions. In the North-West Region, there are  integrated inter-county, inter-region, or even cross-border touristic  provision.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT -</strong> This paper presents some  methodological aspects concerning the use of satellite images and maps in the  physico-geographical region determination of Romania's territory, as well as  some results that can be obtained using this method. In order to determine the  physico-geographical units and sub-units using satellite maps (Bucharest page,  1:1.500.000) and satellite images (Landsat, IRS) we have analyzed, from the  geographical point of view, some samples of such documents. The resulting maps  were compared with the already existing physico-geographical region  determination maps. Our results show that the method under consideration has  both advantages and disadvantages. One conclusion is sure: satellite images and  maps can be used for this purpose together with traditional maps. </p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT - </strong>The aim of this paper is to study the macroeconomic phase which  characterizes present-day Romania, 15 years after the regime- change, embedded  into that regional context which Romania is part of. The regional importance of  this paper is that Romania is the biggest state of the southeastern region as  far as territory and population are concerned. For this reason the country&rsquo;s  economic development cannot be indifferent to the neighbouring states, as it  can have positive or negative social effects on them. The Romanian society was  passing through a slowly and difficult process of democratization and economic  liberalization during the nineties and the turn of the millenium, which was a  similar way to the other post-socialist East European countries. The NATO  membership of Romania and the imminent EU membership in 2007 are important  stimuli to make further progresses on the way to functional capitalism and  welfare. As an express of the efficient economy policy at the end of the  social-democratic administration the economical growth of Romania rose to the  incredible rate of 8.1%, while the budget deficit was only 1.3%. In the autumn  of 2004 was elected a right, liberal coalition-government, which began his  activity with a radical fiscal reform introducing a unique rate of taxes (16%).  In this circumstances the possibility of the avalanche of the FDIs is a real  expectance, but Romania still have to fulfill some other requirements, such as  the reducing of the almost generalized corruption and to maintain the balance  of the budget according to the agreement with the IMF, in order to became a  major economic competitor of the Central-Eastern European region.</p>

         <p><strong>ABSTRACT - </strong> <span class="style12">Climatic regionalization is an important activity of  many Romanian and foreign researchers. This research work has been done for  more than 100 years. For the last 30 years Romania has been divided into  climatic domains, regions and districts, according to the landscape  characteristics of the air mass circulation (wind characteristics) and  vegetation (other important genetic climatic factors were taken also into  account, such as the impact of human society over the natural environment). Theoretically, the latest global and regional climate changes have not  modified the entire climatic regionalization taxonomy. It is divided into the  same domains, regions, and districts. This 30 year-old taxonomy is still in  use, but, practically, the values of the major climatic elements have changed,  mostly at the micro- and topo-climatic level and, especially, in the case of  urban topo-climates. Tomorrow&rsquo;s  climatic regionalization will take more into account human impact and economic  activities. This will be a factor with an increasing impact on the genesis of  the climate, at the micro- and topo-climatic level and at the regional and  local level. In the Banat Plain Area, these changes are mostly noticed at a  local level, because of the topo-climatic appearances or modifications.<br />
  The present study analyses temperature and precipitation parameters in  the Banat Plain Area, in 2000, 2001, and 2002 in comparison to the multi-annual  value from The CMR Banat-Cri&#351;ana Archives and listed at  the meteorological observation stations from S&acirc;nnicolau Mare, Jimbolia,  Timi&#351;oara, Banloc and Lugoj.

          The main idea of our paper is that the  components of sustainable development (efficient economic development, fair  social development, sustainable ecological development &ndash; all these against a  democratic institutional and political framework) should be implemented in  regional geographical entities (the geographical regions) in order to have  maximum efficiency. Our conclusion is that the sustainabledevelopment region should be perceived as  an entity where we can find all the characteristics of sustainable development  (economic, social, environmental development). Our approach is an incipient one  without the pretension that it is definitive and exhaustive.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT - </strong>This  study refers to the trends in precipitation amounts in the central part of Romania  (the Transylvanian Depression) between 1961-2000. The general trend was  calculated using the least-squares linear fitting for the whole period and for  every decade of the period: 1961-1970, 1971-1980, 1981-1990, 1991-2000. The  main results of our research are: during the whole period there is a general  decreasing trend in this region, especially in its southern area; during the  first two decades, there was an increase trend, between 1981-1990 the general  trend was a decrease and the trend for the last decade of the 20th century was  variable.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT  - </strong>Generally,  the Subcarpathian area between the D&acirc;mbovi&#355;a and the Prahova is characterized  by very diverse landscapes and an intense human impact. Secondary or derived  vegetal associations are also present to a large extent, in relative balance  with a certain type and degree of human pressure. Some of these vegetal  associations are extremely rich in flora and fauna. The most frequent are the  lawn associations used as hayfields and pastures. Orchards are often associated  with grassy vegetation used as grazing land or more often as hayfields. There  are relatively frequent shrub clusters and they represent isolated vegetation  on rocky crests or, quite often, an intermediary stage towards the initial  forest vegetation on formerly deforested terrains where there is more or less  intense degradation. All these remain stable as long as man uses them  rationally. When human impact goes beyond nature&rsquo;s capacity to withstand it,  most of the terrains used as grazing land or covered by shrub clusters show  significant degradation, which leads to much fewer species with diminished  productive potential.<br />
          The landscape types  of this Subcarpathian area are: the high hill landscape, the low and medium  altitude hill landscape and the large corridors and depressions landscape.</p>
