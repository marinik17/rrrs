            <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> - Between 2006 and 2008, the National Research  and Development Institute for Urban and Regional Planning URBANPROIECT  Bucharest participated - within the framework of EU programme INTERREG IIIB -  at the DONAUREGIONEN Project: The Spatial  Development Concept of Interregional Cooperation in the Danube Space. The  aim of the project was to create a&nbsp;complex assemblage of knowledge about  the potential possibilities of development in the Danube regions and the  related interregional relations, to initiate common steps when choosing the  regional development centres and to encourage cross-border cooperation. This  action should help to overcome the existing information barriers and also the  local authorities in the stage of planning the regional and city development. The project was structured by a summary  evaluation of the development potential on the Danube area &ndash; analyses of  problems, interests, and conflicts. The elaboration of the summary documents  was based on the general answers to the four thematic fields representing the  basic functional complex: <br />
          1.  Natural resources, environmental protection, and creation;<br />
          2.  Human resources, urban structure, and quality of life;<br />
          3.  Transport and technical infrastructure;<br />
          4.  Economic structure.<br />
          On  the basis of this summary evaluation, a concept of development and arrangement  of the territory of&nbsp;the Danube area and a typology of regions will be  developed and, finally, proposals and recommendations will be elaborated for  regional and local authorities dealing with the regional and city development  planning. <br />
          The  result of the project will be mainly to outline: <br />
          - the  conditions for the optimization of technical, territorial, socio-economic, and  environmental relations in the Danube river corridor; <br />
          - the existence of mutually linked and balanced  urban and economic development centres, which will have positive influence on  the development of their regions, and <br />
          - the conditions for the constitution of  a&nbsp;development corridor that will act as a&nbsp;stabilization agent  balancing the regional disparities in the different member countries.<br />
          The  Geographical information system supporting the elaboration of the Donauregionen  project system was conceived as a working GIS storing all the geographical data  necessary for the processing of project outputs. All the geographical data were  distributed in the WGS-84 system of coordinates. The project area of interest  includes a territory within 5 countries of the Danube region (Slovakia,  Hungary, Serbia, Bulgaria, and Romania).</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> - The paper is part of the study &quot;Specific  problems of the development of the settlement network in south-eastern Romania.  Regions of development 3 (South), 4 (South-West) and 8 (Bucharest-Ilfov)&quot; elaborated during 2004 &ndash; 2006, within the AMTRANS programme funded by the Ministry of Education  and Research, coordinated by INCD &ndash; URBANPROIECT in partnership with the  Institute of Geography of the Romanian Academy and the Qualification in  Statistics National Centre. The  general objective of the project was sustainable and balanced spatial  development of the settlement network and promotion of new relationships  between urban and rural. Concretely, the study has produced a model of a  polycentric and balanced settlement network according to the European  principles. <br />
          The case study  testing and validating this model took place in southern Romania, territory  exhibiting acutely the entire range of problems related to the state of the  settlement network: profoundly large rural areas, accentuated dynamics of  declaring new cities without sufficient evidence, excessive polarization  exercised by Bucharest, etc. The  paper presents the intervention directions needed to balance in the territory  urban poles within the studied area, focusing on the establishment of  orientation policies to consolidate the role of each settlement based on the  hierarchical level of importance: European, national, regional, and local. The  paper also identifies possible functional urban areas: the metropolitan area of  Bucharest, areas of potential strategic integration, areas of cooperation  between the small and medium-sized cities and the rural regions. Within each of  these areas, the paper proposes to establish new relationships between urban  and rural based on partnership, involving cooperation and coordination in  achieving common goals. <br />
          The study considers  that the poles of development are the key element of proposed model, and their  identification, formation, and balanced distribution must represent the main  direction of action, orienting policies for the sustainable development of the  urban system. The constant financial effort needed to implement integrated  policies for a balanced development of the settlement network results into a  long term improvement of living conditions in urbane and rural communities.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT - </strong>VALOT originates in the experience  of European countries from the Alpine Space that succeeded to establish three  top priorities for hardly accessible mountain areas based on communitarian  programs (Natura 2000, Interreg IIIB &ndash; AlpNa Tour, VIADVENTURE, RegioMarket, etc.):  competitiveness and attractiveness of the Alpine Space, accessibility and  connectivity between high altitude settlements, environmental protection and  prevention of natural hazards and disasters (snow falls, land slides, etc.).  Starting from the project of Law on Approving the National Spatial Plan &ndash;  Section VI &ndash; Tourism, the project aims at evaluating the current resources of  hardly accessible mountain areas with complex potentials for tourism according  to the experience of the European Union. GIS analysis will underline  national/regional disparities of these areas, leading to conclusions on their  typology and intervention proposals. The second part will focus on a case study  of a hardly accessible area with a high landscape value and still un-valorized  potentials for tourism. The existing situation of the area between the Lotru  and Par&acirc;ng mountains, consisting of the territories of four communes and a  city, belonging to the counties of V&acirc;lcea and Gorj, will be analyzed. Based on  a spatial development scenario using selected statistical and geographic  indicators, intervention priorities will be analyzed with the SPATIAL ANALYST,  as well as funding possibilities for the creation of a cluster of mountain  resorts (R&acirc;nca, Vidra, Voineasa) in order to valorize the recreational and  balneary patrimony of the area, observing principles and objectives of  sustainable development in mountain areas. The  project will create a methodology for diagnosing problems and dysfunctions of  such areas, development possibilities based on the experience of the pilot  study, proposals for improving the institutional framework for implementing,  monitoring and evaluating the results and (last but not least) funding sources.<strong> </strong></p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT - </strong>Based on the studies of European experience in  spatial planning (policies, strategies, indicators), the project aims to create  two databases for Romania, one at region level and one at the level of the  administrative-territorial unit, in OpenGIS system using adequate indicators allowing  for the identification and measurement of socio-economic development trends in  a spatial context. To achieve this, competent studies will look at the  differences between the European territorial indicators (EUROSTAT, ESPON) and  the national ones, level NUTS II, or NUTS V. Following the identification of  the two sets of territorial indicators, the structure of alphanumeric databases  will be conceived in GIS. Concomitantly with the NUTS V digital map of Romania,  alphanumeric databases will be fed with statistical data according to proposed  territorial indicators schemes. Proposed model will be tested on territorial  analyses by groups of indicators. The novelty consists in the spatial planning  approach based on the conjunction between GIS and mathematical methods of  evaluation and prognosis, the transposition of the mathematical method in a  TurboC++ program, and the integration in the proposed system. Based on the  results, NUTS II and NUTS V territorial indicators will be classified in  groups, in charts and maps underlining socio-economic development disparities  at national level. The GISTEREG project is conceived to be integrated into the  OpenGIS database proposed by ESPON, aiming at a fast quantification of European  regional policies. This is why the structure of the database will be conceived  in accordance with EUROSTAT, level NUTS V, and ESPON and the Regional  Operational Program &ndash; Priority Axis VI, level NUTS II. The proposed GISTEREG  model, due to the mathematical component integrated into the system will be  able to diagnose the main existing challenges and forecast the development of  regions and zones within Romania. Databases obtained and presented in OpenGIS  and mathematical instruments will provide a scientific method that could help  identifying the underdeveloped areas requiring priority interventions based on  European funds. Also, based on the experience of the purposed Consortium,  punctual solutions will be recommended for a balanced development of the  national territory.<strong></strong></p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT - </strong>Biological diversity, interpreted as a variety  of natural and man-dominated biological and ecological systems, plays an  important role in assuring their stability and can be interpreted at different  spatial scales, based on the hierarchical level of the system (biocoenose/  ecosystem, biome/complex of ecosystem, biosphere/ecosphere). Literature  distinguishes six levels of biodiversity, namely alpha, beta, gamma, delta,  epsilon, and omega. The current paper lists methodologies appropriate for  assessing diversity at each of these levels, with a particular focus on  regional diversity (gamma, delta, and epsilon diversities), i.e. CORINE land  cover classification and the biogeographical regions of the European Union.<strong></strong></p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT - </strong>This article intends to disseminate the partial results of a work that  lasted more than three years and involved a substantial number of resources at  both national and international level within the COHESION Project, implemented  under the C.I.P. Interreg IIIB CADSES Neighbourhood Program. The Vrancea  vineyard was the pilot area for the Romanian study and the main activities of  the Romanian team (Urbanproiect Bucuresti, Partner Project no.13) within the  project has been focused on this area.<strong></strong><br />
          The COHESION (Integrated <u>CO</u>ncepts En<u>H</u>ancing Coh<u>ES</u>ion  of Eur<u>O</u>pea<u>N</u> Space) Project aimed at enforcing the cohesion of the  CADSES area, through developing policies to meet the problems of the European  rural space. To this context, the project developed during 2003-2005 applied a  methodology focused on increasing competitiveness of areas. An indicative  product (wine), in which the involved areas provide a comparative advantage,  has been targeted and integrated development pilot projects have been  implemented in the participating areas. The Project's area of intervention  consisted in the territories of Karditsa, Achaia and Nemea in Greece, the  territory of Steirisches Vulkanland in Austria, Meissen in Germany, Appennino  Reggiano in Italy, Northwest Bohemia in Czech Republic, and Vrancea in Romania.<br />
          The aim of the  project was &ldquo;to investigate the development process in remote agricultural  areas from practical point of view, i.e. locate the factors that hamper or  promote local development in the remote agricultural zones of the CADSES area,  and provide this information to other local development actors, so as to  facilitate their action and thus contribute to accelerating convergence of the  space in question and cohesion of the European territory&rdquo; (PINDOS Strategic  Planning Centre, 2006). The approach planned and applied by COHESION was the  bottom up approach. Parallel and similar development projects (pilot  activities) were generated in a number of the areas involved and the experience  acquired by the project partners was compared and examined. A synthesis of the  particular experience in the form of recommendations and hints to potential  local development actors was elaborated under a final manual, a methodological  guide for local development actors, so as to help people involved in the  development practice to avoid mistakes and better plan their actions and thus  become more efficient in their mission.</p>

            <strong>Abstract &ndash;</strong><strong> </strong>The present work  analyses the rainy spells on the territory of the Western Plain at the North of  the Mure&#351; River. Daily precipitation data were used from a number of 5 weather  stations and for a period of 42 years (1961-2002). Only the stations with a  common observation period were chosen. Periods with two or more consecutive  rainy days were studied and the analyses show a total of about 7,000 rainy  spells. The number of the rainy spells grows from the South to the North once  with the latitude but also from the West to the East, once with the altitude. Within a year may occur, on the average,<strong></strong>about 30-35 rainy spells with an average duration of 4 days. The duration of the rainy spells varies  between 2-19 days. On the analysed territory, 119-141 rainy days may occur  annually, on the average. Namely, on this territory it rains on the average  about 4-4.5 months a year. Most of the rainy days were recorded in the  intervals November-January and April-June.&nbsp; </p>

  <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> - The regional problem is always a present one and regional  development that involves the elimination of regional disparities is present as  a fashionable phrase, but also as an effective process within the territory of  the eight regions of development. These have no juridical status but they work  towards a regional development, through the elimination of the intra-regional  disparities (among the counties that are part of a region) and the  inter-regional ones. The regions of development &ndash; formed out of counties &ndash; do  not have administrative status, nor do they have legislative or executive  bodies, but they coordinate projects for regional development. Following their  example, the voluntary associations at inferior levels of the regions resulting  in the so-called &ldquo;microregions&rdquo; are now more and more common. The present study  aims to analyze the way this new notion, &ldquo;microregion&rdquo;, is understood in  Romania, by giving examples of such microregions and their scopes and it also  wants to show how these benevolent associations at a microregional level serve  the aim of eliminating the regional disparities &ndash; in fact, microregional  disparities.</p>
        <p><strong>Keywords</strong>: microregion, regional disparities, planning.<strong></strong></p>
