        <p><strong>Urban Decline and Failed Reconversion Process:  the Role of &quot;Path Dependence&quot; and Governance Theories in Local  Actors' Strategies. The Case of Langreo (Spain)</strong><br />

            <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> - During the sixties and the seventies, most of the European cities  suffered an economic crisis and an urban restructuring process, particularly  the traditional industrial cities and regions. These places suffered a deep  slow-down in their growth and a decline process. In Spain, Asturias is one of  the most affected regions by the crisis, and the Asturian cities specialized in  the mining activity and the traditional industry (Avil&eacute;s, Gij&oacute;n, Langreo and  Mieres) entered a process of decline in the sixties that in some cases  continues today. In Langreo, the strong reindustrialisation policy developed by  the local actors has not contributed to modify the image of &ldquo;industrial city&rdquo;.  Today, the important presence of the industry in Langreo is paradoxical, when  services are the economic driving force of the city and its principal source of  employment. The lack of urban planning has given rise to a deteriorated urban  landscape, where people do not wish to live today because of the proximity of  industrial activities and the troubles that in some ways they cause. This paper  analyses the unsuccessful process of urban and economic renovation as well as  the current situation of Langreo. In order to do this, it uses a methodology  that combines statistical information with interviews with local actors  involved in the city&rsquo;s development. The main results are: (i) A critical  analysis of the situation of Langreo and its future perspectives, (ii) A  summary of the contrast between the different models proposed by the local  actors for the city and (iii) Some conclusions about the importance of  executing an urban organization to fit the economic and employment parameters  with the physical and territorial conditions of the city. Some issues like the  different intensity in the implication of local agents, or the mechanism that  govern the alliances between them also stand out.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash;</strong> The structure of  labour productivity by regions and by economic activities as well as average  sectoral income levels in Romania are analysed within the framework of this  paper. The structure of labour productivity on regional level and by economic  activities is an essential component of regional competitiveness besides the  structure of regional population, the structure of employment by economic  activities in total population at regional level and the structure of total GDP  (or GVA) on regional level by economic activities. To capture the variation in  time of competitiveness, a longer time horizon analysis of the above indicators  is needed instead of analysing just one-year data, which would only give a  static view on the matter. Our analysis covers the 2000-2008 time horizon and  focuses mainly on labour productivity through analysing sectoral GVA and  sectoral employment on the level of Romanian NUTS2 development regions, being  an important determinant of regional competitiveness.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash; </strong>Borders and border  areas require security measures, which are very important to create security on  the borders. The paper also analyzes the role of ethnic groups living near  borderlines. Iran is an ethnically varied country and distinguishing  characteristics of ethnic groups from each other in Iran is particularly  concentrated on language, religion and ethnic components. These ethnic groups  have been scattered as certain minority groups in border provinces and areas.  The presence of Iranian nationals in the Western, Eastern and Northern borders  which are contiguous with countries with the same religion and language creates  by itself an appropriate context for the occurrence of ethnic crises in border  areas and boundary underdevelopment is an another cause for this problem. In  addition, the three components, namely religion, ethnicity, and language,  should be taken into consideration in adopting policies and strategies to deal  with these areas. In Sistan and Baluchestan, Iran, there are effective national  strategies taking advantage of the presence and existence of religious and  ethnic groups in the border towns, adopting security and development policies  taking into account these two issues. They have a deep effect on regional  development and national solidarity due to construction activities and  infrastructure investments on the one hand and reducing insecurity and  trafficking on the other hand. </p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT -</strong> This paper is a demographic  comparative study of two neighboring regions along the southern part of the  Romanian-Hungarian border region, which serves as a fundament for further  analyses concerning the verification of cohesion between the two parts of the  border. We have concluded our study with the statement that in spite of its  traditionally low population increase, the Romanian Timi&#351; and Arad counties  have a more advantageous demographical condition than the neighboring Hungarian  B&eacute;k&eacute;s and Csongr&aacute;d counties, which can be described as having a generalized  demographical decline. Though in Romania the Banat region for many decades is classified  as a crisis-zone from a demographical point of view, it can show off an  impressive attractiveness in terms of inner-migration in contrast to its  Hungarian neighbors. In contrast with the northern part of the  Romanian-Hungarian border, in this region the border strip does not overlap  with a socio-economic periphery, because this phenomenon is more scattered in  space.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash;</strong> The territorial  development of post-communist Romania claims the integration into the  territorial planning process of some principles that regard a balanced and  rightful evolution of the total components of this area. Territorially, the  communist heritage is seen as a particular pattern of land use, in which  gigantic economic structures, oriented towards heavy industry, dependent on one  another and the collective habitat dominated the urban environment while  intensively mechanized agriculture, opposing the traditional customs, was  imposed in the rural areas. Mentally, this heritage is responsible for the  development of resilience to some concepts such as free association, heritage  nationalization and resource rationalization that raise suspicions due to their  forced and wrong implementation into the recent past. If we add the limited  experience of the administration, the incomplete legislative framework and the  lack of specialists, one has an overall view of the issues of the East-European  territories. All these issues raise a series of challenges whose answers seem  to be linked to the integration of the sustainable development principle into  the process that coordinates the territorial development. The &ldquo;land&rdquo; type areas  are specific geographic regions of Romania with deep roots in the historical  past of Romania and with features of regional mental areas. The identity marks  of these areas are given by the high degree of ruralism, conservatism and the  tradition, customs and traditional activities preservation. Once more, from  post-communist transition to the rigours of joining the European Union, the  course of these areas towards sustainable development must pass through the  planning process. The Land of Beiu&#351; is one of the 18 &ldquo;land&rdquo; type areas of Romania,  located in Western Romania (at the foot of the Apuseni Mountains), identifying  itself with the mental area polarized by the town of Beiu&#351;. The total  population is approximately 80,000 inhabitants. The aspects related to the  resilience of this area are given by the rural component, extensive traditional  agriculture and crafts, preservation of ethnic-folkloric traditions and the  existence of some traditional areas, etc. Opposed to this, there are areas that  underwent complex transformations due to the decline of the communist economic  structures, which adapted themselves to the market economy and thus became  global. In this regard, the Land of Beiu&#351; integrates in the same territorial  system both dynamic areas, with mutations of the traditional features, and  resilient conservative areas. Thus, although the Land of Beiu&#351; has no  administrative significance, due to its mental area features it represents a  living organism in the collective mentality of its inhabitants. The evident  resilience of this type of area is completely unexploited, at least until now.  The present study is suggesting the integration of these resilient features of  this area into a strategy of sustainable local development where the regional  peculiarities and the local identity should become landmarks.<br />

  <strong>Advocacy  for the Romanian &ldquo;Lands&rdquo; as Project Territories</strong><br />

            <strong>ABSTRACT - </strong>The present study aims at becoming a manifesto in  favour of the setting up of the &ldquo;land&rdquo;-type Romanian areas as project  territories following an emergent sustainable spatial development. The &ldquo;lands&rdquo;  are regional areas specific to Romania, with geo-historical peculiarities that  enforce them as archetypal mental spaces of the Romanian people. Territorial  cohesion, one of the distinctive particularities of the Romanian lands, is not  valorised at all in the territorial development policies in Romania, although  at European level it represents one of the objectives of regional policy. We  consider that it is the duty of the regional geographers who studied these  areas and worked out extremely valuable studies of territorial diagnosis to draw  the attention of the practitioners dealing with territorial development on  their usability. Thus, the main objective of this study is the scientific  demonstration of the opportunity of such an approach, the theoretical support  being given by the concepts of endogenous development, local development,  &ldquo;land&rdquo;, mental space, project territory. In order to achieve this aim we  started from bringing arguments for the role of regional geography and of the  geographers themselves in the support and scientific validation of the  territorial development, followed by demonstrating the distinctiveness of the  Romanian lands and the opportunity of turning them into project territories, by  comprising the aforementioned theoretical concepts. Last, but not least, we  analysed France's expertise which provided the legal framework for the  establishment of the &ldquo;pays&rdquo;-type areas as project territories and which, we  believe, is worth being considered also in the case of the Romanian lands. </p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT -</strong> Although the  extent to which human capital, economic policies and physical infrastructure  contribute towards economic development continues to generate intense debate in  development studies, there is a consensus that the human capital and the  factors (including health care) that it (human capital) plays very significant  roles in achieving sustainable development including economic, social and environmental  aspects. Sadly, health care quality, as one of the essential components of life  quality of most urban centres in developing countries (DCs), remains largely  unknown. This paper analyses healthcare (including health institutions and  professionals) available in Calabar city in southeastern Nigeria. Despite the  recent emphasis of Cross River State Government on developing the  local-regional and global preferred tourism destination in Calabar city, for  over a decade (since 1999 to the present) as frequently and fondly advertised  in the global media, the policy of health care improvement, as well as other  welfare programmes, have lagged behind the efforts to invite tourists into the  city. To increase the attractiveness of the city for residents, tourists and  investors, policy must incorporate health care improvement programmes into  economic growth and development plans.<br />

        ABSTRACT - The analyzed region is situated in between the mountains and the plain  and represents an area that is perfectly integrated in the natural and human  landscape of the Romanian Subcarpathians. Relying on surveys out in the field  and on questionnaires, our study has examined the ecological impact of the  tourist activities in the tourist resorts of the Ialomi&#355;a Subcarpathians. We  have analyzed, as indicators, the production of domestic waste and the water  consumption in the tourist activity, compared to the quantities produced on a  local level. It can be noticed that the impact of the tourist activities on the  environment is low, both in the case of the production of domestic waste and as  far as the water consumption is concerned. It has been noticed that some  tourist pensions with their own water supply and sewerage systems have a major  effect on the environment when the environmental protection norms are not  respected. The questionnaires filled in both by the local authorities and by  the host communities show that they consider the tourists to be less  responsible for the environmental condition than the local population.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash;</strong> There are two  concepts important for the authors of this article: anisotropic region and  anisotropic space. Anisotropic region is defined by A. Dauphin&eacute;, the geographer  (-mathematician), as a territorial unit whose structure results from the  organisation of space along one or more axes. From the point of view of a  territorial system, this type of region has some characteristics which  differentiate it both from the homogeneous region and from the polarised one.  These specificities have been analysed for Ilva Valley. The region of Ilva  Valley is formed along the morphological axis represented by the Ilva River.  The aim is to identify these specificities or their absence within this region.  In this way we can determine whether this region is an anisotropic one or just  an anisotropic space, namely whether it can be considered as evolving towards  an anisotropic region, not yet complying with all characteristics of anisotropic  regions. </p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT - </strong>The setting up of  metropolitan areas is a process which is still in progress in Romania. The  legislative framework for the creation of these areas has been built up only  since 2001, and there are still a number of juridical inconsistencies  concerning the association of administrative units to form metropolitan areas.  On the other hand, political reasons and the fear of losing a certain degree of  authority and to become subordinates of the large cities (in the case of rural  municipalities) also hindered the development of metropolitan areas in Romania.  Nevertheless, the metropolitan areas already in existence are running a number  of projects that are beneficial for most members of the association. Such  positive examples may trigger the creation of the other metropolitan areas.  Although the existing metropolitan areas did not yield spectacular results, the  time passed since their foundation is yet too short to correctly assess their  usefulness and territorial meaning. For the moment, the following metropolitan  areas exist in Romania: Ia&#351;i, Oradea, Bra&#351;ov, Constan&#355;a, Bac&#259;u, Cluj-Napoca,  T&acirc;rgu Mure&#351; and Craiova. Bucharest, Timi&#351;oara, Ploie&#351;ti and Gala&#355;i-Br&#259;ila  metropolitan areas are still in process of setting up.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash;</strong> The study on the quality of life ( QoL) in urban areas  is gaining interest from a variety of disciplines such as planning, geography,  sociology, economics, psychology, political science, marketing, and is becoming  an important tool for urban planning and management. At present, there is a  great deal of ambiguity and controversy on the concept of QoL, its elements and  indicators. Thus, the present paper focuses on the development of a methodology  for assessing quality of life in urban environment implementing a geographical  informational system model that includes data from different areas of analysis,  as follows: geographical data, Urban Audit socio-economic data, Urban Atlas  data, satellite image data, survey data and indicators. The Geographic  Information model derived from correlating the data mentioned above is used for  evaluating the quality of life in Br&#259;ila, a 200,000 people city, situated in  eastern Romania and port on the Danube River.</p>
