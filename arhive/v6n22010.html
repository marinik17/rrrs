            <strong>ABSTRACT </strong>&ndash; The TICAD project  is in essence a symbiosis between what natural organization of the territory  through the agency of catchment areas means and its anthropogenic organization  having growth poles and gravity axes as pillars. The analysis highlights the  historically-exemplified difficulties in correlating the two forms of  organization and the factors that caused them. An increase of the index of  spatial overlapping and functional imbrication between them can be noticed with  the approach of lower hydrographic taxa (collectors, 1st to 3rd  rank tributaries) and regional taxa (region, county, microregion, commune), a  genuine identification often appearing for the basal ones. The new geopolitical  circumstances, induced by the creation and enlargement of the European Union,  represent a catalyst for the organisation of the Tisa  river basin in the light of the new concepts of economic, cultural or  environmental cross-border collaboration.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash;</strong> Monitoring according to the Water Frame Directive (2000/60/E.C.) guidelines  demands the identification of river water bodies, typology, and investigation  of reference conditions within each river basin. The identification of <strong>&ldquo;water  bodies&rdquo; </strong>based on geographical and hydromorphological determinants is to  enable the status to be accurately described and compared to environmental  objectives of the Directive. A surface water body has to be a discrete element  of surface water, which is not to overlap with each other or to be composed of  elements of surface water that are not contiguous. Heavily modified water  bodies may be identified and designated where good ecological status is not  achieved because of impacts on the hydromorphological characteristics of  surface water resulting from physical alterations. By applying the methodology  described in the guidance document related to the WFD &ndash; Water Framework Directive, identification  and designation of abiotic typology water bodies has led to a number of 32  types of water bodies related to streams and 18 types of water bodies related  to natural lakes. Due to its position and its morphometric features, the Arie&#351; Basin  includes around 12 water body types (eight related to streams and four related  to lakes). A detailed overview regarding the spatial distribution of these  types is also exposed for inside analysis.</p>

  <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash; </strong>The uniform  transnational assessment of the environmental indices in the catchment area of  the Tisa river aims at rehabilitating,  protecting and conserving the environmental systems, as well as creating a <em>commonly strategic demarche</em> <em>concerning a sustainable spatial development</em>,  based on integrated intersectorial approaches of environmental issues, viewed  in their territorial dimension. The information necessary in underlining the  current situation in the Romanian catchment area of the Tisa has been  structured according to the following categories of analysed indices: sources  of surface waters, resources of drinkable water and water supply resources, the  risk of not reaching the environmental objectives, significant sources of water  pollution (<em>punctual sources of pollution,  diffuse sources of pollution, significant hydromorphic pressure</em>), the  quality of water, significant sources of air pollution, soils affected by agricultural  and industrial activities, nature protection and waste management.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash; </strong>We realised this  analysis, as a part of an international project, in order to underline the  potential of this region for its appropriate territorial arrangement targeting  touristic activities.<strong> </strong>In order to  analyse the built patrimony in the Romanian Tisa Basin we considered relevant a  regional synthesis where we analysed territorial units from two general  perspectives (the spatial and the temporal one) revealed in a synthesis and a  map which allowed us underline the significance of capitalising the built  patrimony in this region where the rivers flowing into the Tisa ensured its  unity. We started our study from the list for historical monuments of the  counties with part of their territory or with the whole territory in the Romanian Tisa Basin.  We revealed the importance of the built patrimony in the Romanian Tisa   Basin and the spiritual  heritage belonging to the twelve ethnographic units named &ldquo;lands&rdquo; in several  possible directions of touristic capitalisation we mentioned at the end of our  paper.<strong></strong></p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT -</strong> The analysis of  the land use structure of the 13 counties of the Romanian part of Tisa catchment area has been made according to the 2000  edition of CORINE Land Cover, while the 1990 edition has been used for  comparative purposes. Out of the total area of 8,269,229.48 hectares, the  forests cover 37.92%, the arable lands 35.02% and the grasslands 17.97%. The  other types of land use have lower weights, such as the continuous and  discontinuous urban fabric 4.81%, the orchards 1.10% and the vineyards 0.98%.  In the category of forests, the following types of land use are included:  broad-leaved forests, which form the majority (24.72%), coniferous forests  (6.22%), mixed forests (3.46%) and transitional woodland-shrub areas (3.52%).  The forests are mainly located in the Carpathians and the hills. The  non-irrigated arable lands (23.50%) are predominant within the arable lands.  They lie mostly in the Western Plain and in the basins and corridors of the  Transylvanian Depression and the Western Hills. The analysis of the dynamics of  the land use structure between 1990 and 2000 indicates a relative stability in  the case of forests, a decrease of arable lands and an increase of grasslands.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT </strong>&ndash; A possible answer  to the current challenges of the Tisa catchment area, correlated with water  management, social and economic development, environmental conservation, is the  transnational initiative of the five countries drained by the tributaries of  the Tisa River. In this context, the spatial  development has a major impact on the Romanian Tisa catchment area by providing  the economic cohesion. The purpose of the present paper is to define the  current status of economy in the Romanian   Tisa River    Basin, through the filter of achieving the level  of competitiveness claimed by the national, European, or global authorities. By  setting several quantitative indicators, analyzed for a standard territorial  level (NUTS 3), for a definite time interval (2002-2007), those more or less  competitive economic branches, activities or aspects of the analyzed territory  were identified, and, at the same time, the elements that &ldquo;hinder&rdquo; development,  the traditional remnants, or the existing entrepreneurial initiatives. On the  basis of relevant indicators, the calculation of an index of competitiveness  was proposed at territorial level, the results certifying a certain level of  competitiveness for the region under consideration.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash; </strong>This paper makes a  thoroughly analysis of the main factors which stimulate and define the tourism  in the Tisa River basin in concerning both the primary touristic offer (the  natural and the anthropic frame) and the infra-structural components, in order  to identify the main  opportunities of tourism development that are to be found as well as to  prefigure the direction of this field&rsquo;s development, which points out a real  potential from this point of view. Consequently, after a preliminary  identification of the whole range of tourist resources that are implied or can  be implied in making the attractive endowment of the analysed region, we  establish the main planning priorities, so that &ndash; on this basis &ndash; to indicate  the main types of tourism and the possible tourist arrangements whose  practising and, respectively, achievement, would permit the plenary integration  of the Tisa River basin into the regional, national, and international tourist  circuits.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash;</strong> The complex management of the catchment area proved to be the only  effective way to cope with the extreme hydrologic phenomena and their effects.  The watercourses controlled by artificial lakes have a quasi-total protection,  water-flooding volumes being often fully retained in the man-made water  accumulations. Therefore, both the Some&#351;ul Cald Valley and the Some&#351;ul Mic  stream sector, downstream of Gil&#259;u have been protected from flooding, except  for several outbursts of side tributaries of the Some&#351;ul Mic, with low socio-economic  losses. In addition, the watercourses controlled by small dams with water  adduction pipes have a minimal effect on maximum flow and especially during  flooding periods. In the past, violent effects on the Some&#351;ul Rece catchment  area were recorded in its meadow sector and in the locality bearing the same  name, expressed by the destruction of several civilian targets and of the road  that accompanies the river. </p>
