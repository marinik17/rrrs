          <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> - The decision of the Romanian Government to  connect Romania closer to the realities of the European Union, including  administration, imposes the introduction of a new taxon, the regional one,  equivalent to NUTS 2 level, which did not exist before in the panoply of the  national spatial entities. This has generated a special effervescence of  concerns in the field, reflected in the elaboration of numerous regionalization  scenarios, based on various criteria, from the geographical ones to the  economic, social, political, or heteroclite ones. This is the context in which  the model of territorial division presented below was elaborated. The model was  submitted to the attention of the Romanian Geographical Society during its  annual Conference held in Timi&#351;oara on 25-27 May 2013, being unanimously voted  by the specialists in Geography attending the meeting. </p>

          <strong>Abstract</strong> - The development of the new economy in Eastern and Central Europe  involves a complexity of economic and social processes. The sectoral structures  and territorial location of the industry and the higher education show  significant inequalities. Capital city concentration, low level of research  orientation and insufficient linkages with industries are the most important  barriers to the development of higher education and reindustrialization. The  regional and cohesion policies need strong relations between economic  restructuring and higher education development. The paper focuses on demonst&shy;rating  the regional differences in these fields and proposes the development of  environmental industry and a disciplinary reform in the university training and  R&amp;D.</p>

          <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> - In this article, we  try to give an overview about the major changes and shifts that have determined  the functioning of the spatial planning system in Romania. In this respect, we  use the major legislative acts and the official planning documents from  different scales (national, regional, and local) and the personal experiences  in the development of different spatial planning documents as major information  sources. The main results confirm that, while there is an evident Europeanization  of the planning institutions and documents on national level, the local and  regional levels are still strongly context dependent, mixing characteristics of  three major planning styles: comprehensive integrated, land-use oriented, and  urbanism.</p>

          <strong>ABSTARCT - </strong>The  objective of this study is to present and analyze the regional and local  distribution of the funds allocated by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural  Development (EAFRD), European fund that finances rural development in Romania,  in the post-accession period. This financing instrument was created by the  European Union with the order to continue the main directions of investment of  Special Pre-Accession Programme for Agriculture and Rural Development (SAPARD).  As a member state of the European Union, Romania observes the principles of the  Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) while the development of the Romanian rural  area for the programming period 2007-2013 is supported by the European  Community through the National Rural Development Programme (RDP). This approach  pays special attention to improving the quality of life in rural areas and the  diversification of the rural economy because local communities in Romania have experienced  some changes in this period, while accessing EAFRD funds contributed to  increased regional disparities between developed and poor areas.</p>

          <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash; </strong>This study aims to reveal the characteristics  of circular migrants from Java with focus on migration intentions in the  future, predicted by variables such as wage, age, length of stay, and level of  education. The analysis was done by using binary logistic regression models.  The results showed that wage, age, length of stay, and level of education  together have a significant effect on the migration intentions of circular  migrants from Java. Variables such as wage and education level have a positive  effect, while age and length of stay in the destination have a negative effect.</p>

          <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash;</strong> Cities  have shown remarkable growth due to attraction, economic, social and facilities  centralization in the past few  decades. Population and urban expansion especially in developing countries, led  to lack of resources, land use change from appropriate agricultural land to  urban land use and marginalization. Under these circumstances, land use  activity is a major issue and challenge for town and country planners.  Different approaches have been attempted in urban expansion modelling. Artificial  Neural network (ANN) models are among knowledge-based models which have been  used for urban growth modelling. ANNs are powerful tools that use a machine  learning approach to quantify and model complex behaviour and patterns. In this research, ANN and logistic  regression have been employed for interpreting urban growth modelling. Our case  study is Sanandaj city and we used Landsat TM and ETM+ imageries  acquired at 2000 and 2006. The dataset used includes distance to main roads,  distance to the residence region, elevation, slope, and distance to green  space. Percent Area Match (PAM) obtained from modelling of these changes with  ANN is equal to 90.47% and the accuracy achieved for urban growth modelling  with Logistic Regression (LR) is equal to 88.91%. Percent Correct Match (PCM)  and Figure of Merit for ANN method were 91.33% and 59.07% and then for LR were  90.84% and 57.07%, respectively. </p>

          <strong>Abstract</strong><strong> - </strong>Spatial  differences have become an obstacle for Hungarian competiveness. In addition,  the use or little use of brownfields has even more deepened regional  inequalities. In our opinion, the lack of brownfields revitalisation and lack  of opportunities forced population to migrate. Circular migration would be a  solution to decrease regional inequalities. However, the non-revitalisation of  rust areas prevents implementation of the process. Circular migration means  that the labour force emigrates from the region, but it comes back later and  then they use their competent, acquired knowledge (which they got somewhere  else) successfully to their investments. This process is not fulfilled, as the  non-revitalised brownfields are attractive neither for population, nor for  investors. Our research is based on 263 questionnaires. The major question  groups of the questionnaires are: expectations regarding the labour market,  assessment of home environment and related expectations, the history and  structure of labour relations, employment-related information, potential  employees, interpersonal social capital, income use plans, value system structures.  All in all, the rust fields&rsquo; revitalisation is essential to keep the workforce  and population. Our research aims to contribute to a complex revitalization  strategy, which should have a significant role in the retention of labour, and  its repatriation. <strong></strong></p>

          <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> - Rural tourism is  now determined by limited economic opportunities, poor infrastructure, low  motivation to possible offers, lack of proper service guarantees.&nbsp;Nearly  500 Romanian villages are already tourist locations, with certain  characteristics determined by a heritage item, or complex ones when multiple  components lead to various activities. This  paper includes a typology of tourist villages in Romania according to the types  of practiced tourist activities, insisting on the use of a more comprehensive  terminology: tourism in rural environment, participative and creative tourism  in rural areas.&nbsp;Tourism becomes a system accepted in the rural environment  as a real opportunity for economic development with multiple social  consequences. By multiplying tourism potential to meet tourists&rsquo; demands, many  villages will get tourism valences with various activities in this filed,  including environment protection.</p>

          <strong>ABSTRACT - </strong>Health infrastructure is one of the weaknesses  of socio-economic development in Romania and in other European states. In order  to get a better picture of the Romanian health system issues, this paper  analyzes a number of statistical indicators considered representative for the  national and European health infrastructure for a 20 years period, between 1990  and 2010. Our paper has three main objectives: (a) to identify the main trends  for health infrastructure in some of the European Union countries; (b) to  describe the evolution of the health system in Romania, the comparative situation  at the European level as well as regional level indicators dynamics; (c) to  overview the Regional Operational Program in Romania, how much does it help the  regional health infrastructure in our country. At the European level, there is  a constant decrease in the number of hospital beds. For this indicator, Romania  has slightly higher values than the European average. We must mention that the  hospital beds indicator offers limited information on health infrastructure  which also includes medical equipment and specific devices and practices. The  number of hospitals in Romania increased with 18.9% during the last 20 years  (1990-2010). During the observed timeline, the number of hospitals in Romania  had a constant positive evolution at regional level. The number of doctors in  hospitals has an increasing trend at the local as well as at the international  level. Romania has a number of doctors twice lower than the European average  (3.6 doctors for one thousand inhabitants). The Regional Operational Program  (ROP) has a limited influence in achieving the objectives stated in Applicants  Guide for Priority Axis 3. Major Intervention Area 3.1. This happens because  supporting infrastructure improvements will not create institutional  modernization. The financial contribution through ROP will result in the  modernization of 11% of the existing hospitals in Romania.<strong></strong></p>

  <strong>Urban  Attractiveness. Why Put People&rsquo;s Money into Cycling Facilities?</strong><br />

          <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> - Due to the advantages offered by  agglomerations, human activities have always concentrated, and cities have  become multifunctional places: living places, places where goods and services  are produced, culture and socialisation places. Nowadays however, the negative  effects produced by agglomerations often get to overbalance the positive  effects and to repel people and activities. Agglomerations often become  impersonal and unfamiliar. They are no longer a &ldquo;lived space&rdquo; and people can  hardly wait to &ldquo;evade&rdquo; at least during the weekend. Among the development  factors for which a city should be attractive, Qualified Workforce (QwF) has  become the main one, due to the knowledge society we live in. In the Western  societies, the QwF has met its basic, material needs, also aiming to meet the  others that are linked to the Quality of Life (QoL) (safety, health, mobility,  leisure, etc.). That is why the attractiveness for the development factors is  more and more linked to the QoL that a city offers, the bicycle being able to  bring a large number of answers in this direction. By means of this study, we  will try to show the influence that the bicycle has on the urban attractiveness  factors. We will find out that the bicycle influences them all and, moreover,  without producing any drawbacks in other domains. It exercises however the most  powerful effects on two of the most important soft factors of attractiveness,  namely QoL and image. By noting the increasing importance of the soft factors  in relation to the hard factors, we will be able to sustain the opportunity of  investing in facilities for bicycle. Moreover, we will show that a city which  aims to remain competitive on the global market of the development factors has  no more choices and has to become bicycle-friendly.</p>

          <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash;</strong> The town views were a constant preoccupation  of the European scientists, artists, geographers and military stuff, sometimes  without a distinct separation between them. Starting with the 17th  century, the correct representations of space became a predominant military  matter, controlled by the engineers of the main monarchies of Europe. Even so,  it remained more &ldquo;space&rdquo; to conquer and the artists proved to be real agents of  change, especially &ldquo;vedutisti&rdquo;, concerned to catch that complex <em>genius loci</em> which combines spectacular  landmark panoramas with everyday life, choosing Europe&rsquo;s main cities as  scenery. Transylvania region has also experienced a similar process due the  influence of the Age of Enlightenment, but with a delay specific to its  peripheral geographic position and political status. The city of Cluj-Napoca  was one of the favourite subjects of the foreign and local artists, which  proved to be very sensitive to the trends of the urban change capturing the  local colour as a statement of the historic past, but also as a change in  perceiving the urban space. Compared with almost one-sided urban views of the  past centuries, the 19th century brings a 360-degree perspective  over the urban space, significant for the future development of the city.</p>
