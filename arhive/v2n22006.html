            <strong>Abstract</strong><strong> &ndash; </strong>For geographical regionalisation, the mental criterion  we proposed in 2002 proves to be really helpful in establishing the limits of  functional territorial systems. Secondly, it stores their structure and  evolutionary features, especially the social (cultural) and behavioural ones.  The Carpathians appear as the <em>Romanian  primordial archetypal mental space </em>and this is also an unquestionable proof  of the formation, evolution, and continuity of the Romanian people in the  Carpathians and in the territories neighbouring this mountain chain. </p>

            <strong>Abstract  &ndash; </strong>The  long area from the Baltic to the Adriatic and the Black Sea between the German  and the Russian (and the 19th century Turkish) empires is called Eastern-Central Europe in the Hungarian academic  discourse. The peoples living here were forced to conform to these big empires  for long centuries. They needed strong adaptability in the 20th century, after  the disintegration of the Austrian-Hungarian Monarchy, too. The independent  states that emerged as succession states had to conform sometimes to the  empires in the west and sometimes to those in the east both in an economic and  a political, and a social sense. Economic development was influenced  considerably by the political ambition of building an independent country,  which meant radical elimination of century-long relations. Every country made a  new, centrally controlled internal regional division. This was what happened in  all the different political systems. In these decades, borders, both state  borders between countries, and administrative boundaries within a country  played an important part. Central political intention could only manifest  itself through a hierarchical system, which postulated the exact detachment and  the strong protection of the individual administrative areas. Consequently, the  belts along the borders of the countries increasingly became depressed areas.  The number of the inhabitants decreased and the population was ageing because  the economy in these areas was not developed. In the new bourgeois period it  was the economic political ambition of each country to be able to join world  economy. On our continent the easiest way to achieve this aim was to join the  European Union. However, as members of the European Union, these countries have  to give up their former policy of isolation and they have to form organic  (economic) regions. We can witness the weakening process of borders. This holds  true for both state borders and administrative boundaries and the new method of  enforcing central political will. The democratic bourgeois establishment tries  to reduce the power of hierarchical systems. The increasing economic relations  between the countries, the increasing role of cross-border relations, and the  disputes regarding internal regional divisions are all markers of this process.</p>

          Abstract - The Allier  department has an incredible range of landscapes among which the bocage is the  most representative. The bocage is an enclosed field with scattered households.  Some areas are also totally free of hedge. We did not want to compare the  openfield and the bocage but we tried to prove that there was a different type  of bocage. So we studied two opposed sectors situated in the East and in the  West of this department. The use of aerial shootings and their processing in a  G.I.S. (Geographical Information System) allowed us to map the differences  between the two areas in the last 50 years. This objective description obtained  from actual and past data helped us analyse the change factors in the whole  bocage of the Allier department. </p>

            <strong>Abstract</strong> - The geomorphologic processes are usually  limited as area of occurrence. They can be localized punctually, but the  transformations they induce are irreversible and can produce very important  environmental changes such as landscape transformations, loss of human lives,  destructions of elements of the cultural heritage or taking agricultural lands  out of use. In this paper, we tried to establish a regionalization of the  geomorphologic processes at risk by applying a weightening method that  considers both the favourable and triggering factors for this type of processes.<br />

            <strong>Abstract  -</strong><strong> </strong>The Land of Maramure&#351;  is one of the most representative natural regions. It has become a cross-border  region on a segment of the Romanian-Ukrainian border because of the evolution  of human society. The placement of the present border on the material and  spiritual convergent axis represented by the Tisa Valley  (in 1920) determined a reorientation of the transport systems of the two  Maramure&#351; components. The transition from the planned socialist economy to the  market-oriented one in 1990/1991 produced rapid changes both in the structure  of the transport systems and in the orientation of the transportation flow. The  new conditions allowed the appearance of the first tendencies to restore the  Maramure&#351; transport system. Still, the different ways chosen by the two  countries (Romania and Ukraine)  in their relation with the European power centres created new barriers for  these new tendencies. </p>

            <strong>Abstract  -</strong><strong> </strong>The paper presents the actual  state and condition of territorial inequalities at the Romanian-Hungarian  border region, which shows - at present - an evident advantage of the Hungarian  side, from the point of view of complex socio-economical aspects. This  advantage is especially outstanding for the Hungarian side in the field of  infrastructural supply (drinking water, natural gas, and public sewage  networks), but it is valid for some characteristics of human capital, too,  (above all, with regard to the illiteracy rate and the proportion of highly skilled  persons with bachelor degree). Despite these difficulties, these inequalities  are not insurmountable and should not affect efficient cross-border cooperation  between the two countries. This regional inventory facilitates the evaluation  of the starting-point of this kind of cooperation and also depicts some aspects  of the interregional cooperation of the four counties north of the  Romanian-Hungarian border region which belong to the Carpathian Euroregion.</p>

            <strong>Abstract -</strong> Agricultural land is the main land use  category in the Republic   of Moldova. Agricultural  land was 74,5% of the surface of the republic on January 1st  2005.&nbsp; The dominance of agricultural  landscape has been a reality on this territory since the beginning of the  nineteenth century.<br />
          During the latest 15 years,  agricultural land has been dwindling (by 44.4 ha per year). During the latest 5  years this rhythm has become more stable (about 2.543-2.520 ha).<br />
          From the spatial point of view, the structure of land  is relatively homogenous. Agricultural land represents the main land use  category in most of the villages. At the beginning of 2005, agricultural land  varied between 47.9 % (Str&#259;&#351;eni Department) and 87.4% (Drochia Department).<br />
          Territorial differentiations in land use are caused by  the variety of natural conditions (particularly, the morphological conditions  and, partially, the soil and climatic conditions) as well as the population  factor.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT - </strong>In a relatively  uniform natural environment, the settlements in the Baia Mare Depression have  very diverse forms. According to an oriented complex typology, we have  identified the features and the problems characteristic of these settlements,  according to the following criteria: the infrastructure already, demographic  features, education, health, and tourism. By synthesising these criteria, we  identified the following settlement types: polarising urban centres, under-pressure  urban settlements, important rural settlements, under-pressure rural  settlements, and declining rural settlements. Each of these types shows that it  is necessary to differentiate our intervention, i.e. territorial planning  activities must respond accordingly to local and regional needs. </p>

            <strong>Abstract</strong> - After the  collapse of its economic system, Romania entered a new economic,  social, and political period named transition. The transition from a planned  economy to a market oriented one, the opening of the borders, the consolidation  of the political and juridical systems led to the appearance of foreign direct  investment as well as to its permanent increase. Against the frame of internal  changes, the Romanian foreign policy evolved in a new direction marked by the  country joining NATO and its accession to the European Union. After 1989,  economic, political, and demographical changes influenced all Romanian  settlements. Still, these changes had selective effects pushing some counties  to progress and other to decline. Foreign investment concentrated especially in  the areas where the infrastructure already built, the development level, and  accessibility were more significant as well as the area where the local factors  were more interested in making changes. This contributed to regional  disparities as investment focused especially in Bucharest and in the North-West and West  Development Regions. In our study we present the evolution of foreign direct  investment in Romania  in the last years and the disparities between regions and counties. </p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT -</strong> We used two indicators in order to quantify population&rsquo;s concentration  level in a certain area: Lorentz curve and Gini ratio. For our research we took  into account two years - 1985 and 2002, in order to compare the period previous  to 1990 and the one after it. We noticed that a demographical deconcentration  process caused by population decrease and disappearance of certain settlements  was characteristic of the Danube Valley, in the Giurgiu and Br&#259;ila sector. We  could identify eight evolution models specific to the rural settlements of this  area, with four increase and four decrease models. </p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> &ndash; Starting from  identifying the appearance, the maintenance, and the increase of industrial  imbalance in the Land   of B&acirc;rsa, in this study  we focused on both the industrialisation process, with its four evolutionary  stages (<em>localisation, selective  concentration, regional polarisation, and mobility</em>) and on the existing  industrial disparities. Year 1990 was the starting point for increasing these  disparities with a significant impact on economy, population, the settlement  system, and the environment. Some of the factories were shut down, others  underwent bankruptcy, and industry changed its evolutionary trend to a rapid  decline. <br />
          The &ldquo;deindustrialisation&rdquo; syntagm covers the new path followed by  industry during the transition period, from a centralised economy to a  market-oriented one that was supported by industrial reorganisation and  privatisation. Either for the former or for the latter, the main purpose was  the same: diminishing and eliminating the present industrial imbalances. <strong></strong></p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT </strong>&ndash; The technical town endowment (drinking and  industrial water supplies, sewerage, district heating, natural gas and electric  power supplies, telecommunication, access to means of transportation)  represents a basic condition in assuring the quality standard concerning the  population&rsquo;s life and the economic development.<br />
          Furthermore, it  represents a premise in order that the connections between the centre-town and  the suburbs, take place in optimal conditions. Considering all of the above,  when talking about towns in the district of Cluj, the presence of important  differences can be noticed between the towns proper and their suburbs, but also  between themselves. Finding where these issues occur is a matter of great  importance in order to improve them by investments, which would be an essential  step in assuring support in order for towns to function at optimal rate.</p>

            <strong>Abstract -</strong>This Sub-Carpathian sector polarised all economic life  in D&acirc;mbovi&#355;a County,  as its territory was also in the past a crossroads of the most important  commercial routes along the Ialomi&#355;a, connecting Transylvania with the south of  nowadays Romania  and, therefore, the number of people was greater than for other Romanian  regions. Between 1930 and 2002 the population of the Sub-Carpathians between  the Prahova and the D&acirc;mbovi&#355;a increased continuously according to certain  economic, social, and cultural trends. We noticed that population natural  growth rate decreased from 1992 to 2002 down to negative values because of both  population aging and problematic medical assistance. At the same time, the  migratory growth rate had an endo-dynamic feature in the areas where the  natural growth rate was small and an exo-dynamic feature where the labour force  was exceeding request and the unemployment rate was high. </p>
