            <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> - New strategies of the European Union, focused directly on regional  development or originated from different areas, but leading to changes in this  field, had resulted into a set of indices used to monitor the effects of their  implementation. Previous studies suggest that flexible systems perform better  and could strengthen the administrative capacity of accessing structural and  cohesion funds. Our study used the Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to  produce hierarchies of the territorial indices at NUTS level II, displayed as  charts and maps underlining the disparities between the socioeconomic, cultural  and environmental aspects of the development. The results suggest that the  regions with a low potential of development are situated in the south of  Romania, but, most important, underline the potential of the method to be used  as a planning tool in regional development, as its flexibility allows for an  input with particular focus from different stakeholders, resulting into the  selection of different indices and weights.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT -</strong> Spatio-temporal analysis was applied on data representing  urbanisation, slumisation, poverty, safe water/ sanitation in urban sub-Saharan  Africa (SSA). The findings include: rapid rates of national population growth  and urbanisation throughout SSA from 1980 to 2005, averaging 93.8% (range: 90.5%  points), lowest and highest rates being 40% (Lesotho) and 130.5% (Niger),  respectively; high national poverty rates, widespread in SSA: (&gt;50% in about  seven countries; it might have been similar in more countries if a large number  of SSA countries had reported their 1993 poverty rates; high urban/rural  poverty ratios (1.05-1.79 points range) between Nigeria and Benin Republics.  High average rate (73%) of slumisation in SSA in 2001 (range: 96%), lowest and  highest rates being in Zimbabwe (3%) and Chad/Ethiopia (99%), respectively.  SSA&rsquo;s 2000 health adjusted life expectancy was generally low: 38.8 years  (&lt;40 years in 24 countries).&nbsp; Use of  safe/improved water/sanitation services were poor almost throughout SSA: declined  rapidly and ubiquitously from 72% (2000) to 55% (2002), minus 17% points  decrease in three years within individual countries with alarming declines up  to minus 69% points in Guinea. The policy implications of the findings include  the urgent and imperative need to massively implement urban improvement  programmes designed to provide health-inducing services/facilities across SSA.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT - </strong>There is empirical  proof that some localities consistently grow faster than others and these  differences in economic growth rates cannot be explained only with respect to  one local factor. However, economists have given surprisingly little attention  to the question of the sources of variation in local growth rates, especially  to the ones related to strategic planning. Moreover, in many cases, regional  strategies have failed to address local development patterns. Previous  scientific contributions on good government issues show a strong correlation between  the per capita income growth and various measures of local strategic planning.  The aim of this paper is to integrate different approaches on local economic  development, by elaborating a local strategy for the Municipality of Gherla, in  North-West Romania. The analysis of the economic pre-conditions is based on a  collection of micro-data, while the planning outputs are the result of a  participative process, including a survey among citizens and workshops with  local business and public bodies. The study concludes that when focusing on  local economic development, strategic planning should be a task of local  participative process that considers not only the regional and national  priorities but also the local specificities. Moreover, the study gives recommendations  for continuing the process of local strategic planning.<strong></strong></p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT  - </strong>Romania, following the abolishment of the communist  regime, has entered a new stage of development, not just on a social dimension,  but from a political and economic point of view as well, this process being the  so called transition. As result, many of the state owned companies have been  transferred into the private sector, a process that has closely been followed  by the emergence of enterprises established entirely with private capital. The  increase of their numbers was anything but linear, with many oscillations  correlated with the state of the economy and the changes in the legislation.  Furthermore, these changes have taken place at a different pace in the  different parts of the country, contributing to the rise of disparities  regarding the number and development of SMEs in the whole territory of the  country. These property transfers, besides the aspects mentioned earlier, have  dramatically influenced the number of the occupied population, resulting &ndash;  around the middle of the nineties &ndash; in the increasing rate of unemployment,  which has gradually started to decrease due to new jobs created by newly  established private firms, but also because of the way the Romanian State keeps  evidence of the unemployed people. This study will mainly concentrate on  analyzing the changes that have taken place in the last years as regards the  number of SMEs in Romania, on measuring inequalities in the different areas of  the country from this point of view, as well as their trend and their effect on  occupying the country&rsquo;s workforce.</p>

  <strong>Territorial  Disparities in the Population Dynamics. Comparative Analysis Between  Bucharest-Ploie&#351;ti Corridor and Bucharest-Pite&#351;ti Corridor</strong><br />

            <strong>ABSTRACT - </strong>The present paper is a comparative analysis of  territorial disparities in the population dynamics of the settlements along two  corridors of major national importance.<strong> </strong>The objective is to prove that a  key corridor starting in the capital city of a country has both positive and  negative effects on the network of settlements it goes through. The capital  influence is widely felt in both areas studied, nevertheless there are  differences which were analysed starting from the premise that the borders of  Bucharest metropolitan area are currently up to 50 km around the capital and  that the area of influence is continuously expanding territorially. These  differences are generated by the fact that although Bucharest is a major pole  of social-economic phenomena, its influence on the settlements in the  neighbouring area varies in intensity because urbanisation, development and  modernisation are intense, but within a limited area.<strong> </strong>The existence of  the two corridors had an impact upon the configuration of localities causing  the extension of the built-up areas in the localities close to the roadway, especially  parallel to it. This is particularly related, but it is not limited to the  increase in the supply of/demand for land plots earmarked for building  dwellings of a higher standard &ndash; main or secondary residences.<strong> </strong>The  evolution of the population dynamics of the settlements alongside the two corridors  is closely related to the social-economic changes occurred in the area  influenced by the three cities (Bucharest, Ploie&#351;ti and Pite&#351;ti) and to the  intensification of urbanisation.<strong></strong></p>

  <em>The Evolution of  Regional Disparities in the Rural Areas of Muscelele Arge&#351;ului</em><br />

            <strong>ABSTRACT  - </strong>Regional disparities are  clearly a significant challenge to the new European construction. Disparities  are often sources of instability but are also the sources of antagonism and  unrest. In the case of Muscelele Arge&#351;ului, in the past, it was a unitary area  in terms of economic and social development, the two Middle Ages royal capitals  keeping the balance of this area. After the 50s, the situation changed  radically, and the uneven development of the towns and villages began to widen.  Some villages were collectivized; others were industrialized, while a third  category was simply omitted from the development plans. As a consequence,  development disparities evolved and became common during the 80s. After 1992,  around the towns of Curtea de Arge&#351; and C&acirc;mpulung, two relatively more  developed regions emerged, while regions in the north and central part of the  area were disadvantaged. Since 2002, we are witnessing a reduction of disparities  because the underdeveloped areas are increasing and incorporate previously  developed areas. The area is starting to become  a huge underdeveloped area and one of the main factors that led to this  situation is the decay of the two poles of regional development, as well as  coal mines closed. Today, the entire area is  experiencing a rebirth and the entrepreneurial activities are playing an  important role. The huge number of small hotels and accommodation  establishments, constructed in the last five years in the west part of the area,  coupled with several investment projects in Curtea de Arge&#351; have led to the  increased regional importance of the town to the expense of C&acirc;mpulung. In the  meantime, former mining centres that where the engines of growth for the region  became rather underdeveloped. The main cause of this is the fact that the  region does not have perspectives and lacks the much needed entrepreneurial  activities. </p>

  <strong>The  Spatial Distribution of Settlements in the B&acirc;rg&#259;u Mountains</strong><br />

            <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> &ndash; Based of the specific  geomorphologic and hydrologic background, the B&acirc;rg&#259;u Mountains have faced an  extensive and prolonged human process, the main vectors being the two morpho -  hydrographic axes&nbsp; (Ilva-Le&#351;u and  B&acirc;rg&#259;u-Bistri&#355;a), including the interfluvial areas, which were introduced, in  different degrees, into the humanized territory. Thus, <em>two habitational zones</em> are distinguished, the one of Ilva and Le&#351;u  (in the central part) and the one of B&acirc;rg&#259;u and Bistri&#355;a, in the south. The  present study aims at emphasizing the main aspects connected to the territorial  distribution of habitats in the B&acirc;rg&#259;u Mountains, from a double perspective: <em>quantitative</em> and <em>morphological</em>. The analysis of the quantitative distribution of  settlements was made starting from the calculation of some synthetic indicators  (the settlement density, the area coefficient, the dispersion indicator, the  average distance between two localities). As altitude plays an important role  in the spatial distribution of habitats, four &ldquo;generations&rdquo; of settlements were  identified depending on the elevation levels. The most numerous localities in  the B&acirc;rg&#259;u Mountains (16 out of the total of 20) are situated between 601 and  1100 m, illustrating the specific morphometrical features of the territory.  Besides the role that the terrain plays in the distribution of habitats, the  swarming processes (through displacement and saltation) have to be mentioned,  as they contributed to the confinement of the forest surfaces, so that, now,  the B&acirc;rg&#259;u Mountains represent a strongly humanized area. </p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT - </strong>Through its  activities, one way or another, Man leaves a mark upon the environment. The  Desn&#259;&#355;ui Plain is an important agricultural region, a feature also confirmed by  the increased number of rural settlements and a high percentage of arable  lands. Practicing agriculture, man exercises a pressure upon the environment  through various types of land use: arable, vineyards, orchards, pastures and  grasslands. In order to be able to analyse the interaction between the man and  the environment, we used the following formulae P = S/N where P represents the  human pressure (ha/inhabitant), S = surface of the analysed area (ha) and N =  number of inhabitants from the analysed area. The data was collected from the  Regional Department of Statistics of Dolj and from the County Department of  Statistics of Mehedin&#355;i, processed using mathematical formula and interpreted  based on the resulted maps.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong></strong></p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT </strong>&ndash; Since early 1989,  the small settlements of Nehoiu and Pogoanele, located in the south-eastern  part of Buz&#259;u County and declared towns in the same year, entered a new stage  of evolution.<br />
          After a long period of evolution under socialism, people and especially  authorities decided to adjust the evolution and the development of settlements.  This change did not only have repercussions on the entire economic base but  also on the population, imprinting a descendent evolution. Economic  restructuring is felt on the quality of life, purchasing power is increasingly  smaller, many families are poor, with the possibility of living only from one  day to another. Industry and agriculture have suffered the biggest change in the  sense that the labour force in these two areas has steadily decreased. Current  development opportunities include: increasing the share of active population in  the tertiary sector and attracting investors from the private sector.</p>
