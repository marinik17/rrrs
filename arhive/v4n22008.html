            <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> - The present paper  attempts to demonstrate the theoretical role of elementary structures in the  dynamics of territorial systems. Territorial systems are conceived as  complex entities, defined by differentiated quantities of interdependences  between natural and anthropic components, spatially projected. Analogously to  physical structures at a spatial level, territorial macro-systems (global,  continental, national), territorial medium-systems (regional, intraregional),  and micro-systems (local and infra-local) could be individualized. At the level  of the last category, it is important to individualize an indivisible  territorial organization structure whose dynamics is essential for all the  territorial systems placed at upper scales.<br />
          By their number,  such structures<strong> &ndash; </strong>having thresholds  defining their critical mass, by cluster or functional integration types &ndash;  respond to anthropic and natural interventions through specific forms resulting  from adaptation-type processes, with great self-organizing capacity.  Synthetically, we could define such a hypothesis as being connected with  spatial structures similar to those existing in physics, called spatial  nanostructures. Since such a structure, as a  physical size compared with the Earth size, could be a multiple of 10-9.</p>
        <p><strong>Keywords: </strong>spatial<strong> </strong>nanostructures,  dynamics, territorial systems.<br />

            <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> - This study focuses on the spatial structure of the  European Union. The aim of the research is to analyse the geometric models of Europe&rsquo;s core area. We have a lot of flat shapes for the  spatial structure: we have axes, polygons and they have a lot of different  geographical extensions in Europe. These  formations have been collected from numerous studies and they have been  compared based on different statistical data. Moreover the pentagon, the newest  model of EU is described in different respects.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> - The area of Lake Balaton is  one of the most familiar and, after the capital region, the second most  frequented part of Hungary.  No wonder, this region is an accentuated topic of Hungarian social, economic,  and ecological researches. This paper aims to deal with its two crucial  problems: first, this area does not compose a separate planning and statistical  region, so it does not fit the NUTS system, which serves as base of development  policy. On the other hand, this area needs to be handled as a complex, because,  since the change of regime, it has had a decreasing development course and a  lot of problems have arisen not only in local economy and, thus, in local  society, but also in the context of environment.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> &ndash; In the evolution of the Romanian mental space, four  distinct stages can be emphasized, each of them bringing its specific  contribution to its defining and structuring. These stages are the following:  the forerunning, Dacian stage, the 2nd century B.C. - 106 A.D.; the  incipient, Dacian-Roman stage, 105 &ndash; 275 A.D.; the  structuring, proto-Romanian stage, 275 &ndash; the 6th and 7th  centuries; the Romanian stage of completion and affirmation, the 8th  century &ndash; nowadays. Each stage is characterized by different forms, in  continuous affirmation and improvement, of interrelations between the human  communities and the site, of spiritually sublimation of the  physical-geographical substratum features, of the territory inhabited by them. </p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> - The demographic situation within the Northern  Economic Region is worse than the national average. This fact is determined by  the decrease of the birth rate values, the increase of the mortality values and  the negative natural and migration growth. They also lead to a change of the  rate between age groups, in favour of the elderly. In order to diminish such a  situation, urgent measures should be taken (policies for economic increase and  income increase) at local, department and regional level, to stop the deep  demographic crisis of the region.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT - </strong>The changing of  the economic, social and political system in Romania brought the need of a  significant shift in spatial planning paradigm. Between 1990 and 2005 it became  clear gradually that the spatial plans, as they were conceived, are not anymore  able to really support a structured approached of spatial development. The main  problems identified are: the lack of strategic dimension of spatial (territorial)  development plans; the modest cooperation among sectoral ministries and other  national relevant bodies in order to organize and integrate national public  investments programs at the national scale; the lack of awareness of sectoral  and territorial actors regarding their potential and responsibilities in  territorial development; the lack of core technical and legal tools in  territorial planning. <br />
          Few  consequences of the above situation are: the lack of the vision for Romania&rsquo;s  territorial development at the national level and as a state member of the EU;  there are no in place yet national policies, based on intersectoral  cooperation, that could be implemented by sectoral policies, and could provide  background for national public investments programs, for strategic documents  that substantiate the use of EU funds; very few institutions use the spatial  plans as instruments in the process of planning specific issues with  territorial impact and relevance.<br />
          In  2005, the former Ministry Delegate for Spatial Planning, Public Works and  Constructions (within the Ministry of Transport, Constructions and Tourism),  currently Ministry of Development, Public Works and Housing (MDPWH), initiated  a process of the reform in spatial planning.<br />
          The  paper presents: a) the reform process and design, its components and main  directions for action, and b) the strategic document which takes the role of  trigger of the reform process, relevant steps in its development and current  stage of ellaboration.</p>
    <p><strong>Keywords:&nbsp; </strong>reform, spatial planning, spatial strategic development,  inter-institutional and territorial partnerships.<br />

            <strong>ABSTRACT - </strong>The paper analyzes the relationship between the  juridical system and the hierarchy of settlements in Banat, Romania.  The historical development of the law institutions is presented, highlighting  the peculiarities of the region. The present juridical organisation is also  thoroughly analysed. Emphasis is laid on the importance of the Appellate Court  in Timi&#351;oara,  the county courts and the trial courts, and their magistrates. The number and  territorial distribution of the auxiliaries of justice, the lawyers and  notaries public, sheds light on the significance of certain settlements for the  law system. The hierarchy of central places in Banat  is studied from the perspective of the juridical organisation. In conclusion,  the established hierarchy is uncontested for the first four levels, including  the cities of Timi&#351;oara, Arad,  Re&#351;i&#355;a, Lugoj  and Caransebe&#351;. Nevertheless, there are significant differences between the  smaller towns of the lower levels.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT -</strong> In the Crisul Repede Valley  TPU, an area lying in the northern part of the Apuseni Mountains, alongside the  attractions as regards the relief there are, beneficially, other natural  attractions such as: a climate suitable for winter sports (a large amount of  snow, for a long period of the year), thermal and mineral water sources,  Karstic intermittent springs, numerous lakes and waterfalls; forests that are  habitats for important game; unpolluted rivers, with a species-rich fish  population etc.<br />
          The heavily  inhabited feature of the area means that there is a wealth of man-made  resources for tourism: forts, wooden churches, monasteries, museums, historical  monuments; all this justifies the development and promotion of rural tourism.  Equally importantly, the Romanian village falls into the category of the most  generous and attractive human settlements in the context of European Rural  tourism offer.<br />
          Therefore, it is  imperative that the endeavor of implementing modernity should be assimilated  without thwarting, altering or compromising these invaluable qualities. <br />
          At present, the  economic, political, psycho-social and legal conditions have been summoned with  a view to the development of tourism in the rural space in the area, and the  local population has expressed availability for involvement in and commitment  to administering their own resources, including that of supporting tourism.<br />
          The defining  features of rural tourism are discernable in the space analyzed here: i.e. a  wide, varied offer range, that meets the requirement for authenticity, the  originality and sheer quality of the physical environment, the specificity of  the economic life-styles, mentalities, traditions etc.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash;</strong> Ro&#351;ia Montan&#259; is the  greatest gold ore in Romania  and one of the greatest in Europe, and its  exploitation has been carried out since Antiquity up to nowadays. <br />
          If the traditional  extraction and processing technologies had a minimal impact upon environment,  the ones adopted in modern times have affected all the components of the  natural environment. <br />
          In the perspective  of capitalizing the gold ore through the programme elaborated by the Canadian  company, Gold Corporation, the zonal geographical space will be degraded up to  the level of industrial dessert over an area of 100 km2 and in case  of damage, the affected area can extend enormously. <br />
          The environmental  problems are related both to the specific nature of such an industrial activity  and, especially, to the use of enormous quantities of sodium cyanide directly  on the preparation flux from the industrial plant. <br />
          Few such cases are  known worldwide, in several economically less developed countries. Usually,  cyanides are used for treating the gold concentrations, operation done in  conditions of maximum security, in closed spaces, situated in isolated zones  and the neutralization (detoxification) of cyanides is done in situ. The  treatment of cyanides in open spaces has always generated environmental  problems. Moreover, none of the cyanide treatment technologies eliminates  entirely their toxic effect (less toxic chemical products are obtained). <br />
          In order to avoid  the production of an environmental disaster and to preserve the local patrimony  values (in this place there lies the richest mining archeological site in  Europe), we elaborated several recommendations we consider feasible as they  allow both the capitalization of ore, which is a socio-economic necessity of  the area, and the ecological reconstruction of the affected geographical  space.&nbsp; </p>
        <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> gold, Ro&#351;ia Montan&#259;,  mining activity, ecological impact, risks. <br />

            <strong>Abstract &ndash;</strong><strong> </strong>The increased frequency of the<strong> </strong>climatic hazards requires more and more detailed studies on this  issue. Thus, the present paper aims at identifying the critical precipitation  spells for the Transylvanian Depression area. In this respect, statistical data  from 1971-2000, recorded in 10 weather stations (Cluj-Napoca, Blaj, Sebe&#351;, Tg.  Mure&#351;, Dumbr&#259;veni, Sibiu, F&#259;g&#259;ra&#351;, Dej, Bistri&#355;a, Odorheiu Secuiesc) were used.  The main conclusions are the following: in the analyzed region,<strong> </strong>most of the days within the year  (110...131 days) have a frequency of precipitation occurrence between 30...40  %;<strong> </strong>at the weather stations protected  by the Apuseni Mountains and by the Southern Carpathians (Blaj, Sebe&#351;, Sibiu),  the &ldquo;precipitation shadow&rdquo; is felt and so, the number of rainy days with an  occurrence frequency higher than 40% decreases if compared to the other  analyzed weather stations within the studied area; the length of critical  precipitations spells, common to most of the analyzed weather stations, ranges  between one and 21 running days (for an occurrence frequency higher than 40%)  and between one and 6 running days (with an occurrence frequency higher than  50%), respectively; critical precipitation spells, common for the entire  region, are missing in March, while in August and October have a very low  frequency (1-2 days).<strong> </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Keywords: </strong>critical precipitations spells (CPS), daily amount of precipitations,  frequency, Transylvanian Depression.</p>
