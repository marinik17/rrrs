            <strong>Abstract </strong>- The Crimean peninsula is a perfect example for the  discrepancies between the approach of zonality taking the main vegetation and  soil formations mainly as climate dependent and so as natural and the  acceptance of an accelerated development of cultural landscapes. Crimea underwent several periods of profound economic  ethnic and cultural changes comparable to its present dimension of  &ldquo;transformation&rdquo;, which always affected the exploitation of natural resources.  Thus only a few examples of &ldquo;real steppe&rdquo; exist between the extensively or  intensively settled and cultivated areas. However several reports on intensive  cereal cultivation on the Crimean plains during Greek, Hellenistic and  Byzanthinian times may shed another light to the assumed natural grassland  vegetation (cf. Mack &amp; Carter 2003). Thus the question for the &ldquo;steppe&rdquo; as  a grassland-chernosem system should be discussed again. The fact of  predominance of cultural landscape systems on the peninsula should necessarily  be incorporated in all conservation plans. The exclusion of further economic  use or its profound change will again start processes of succession, and  finally the goal of the preservation of human's modified ecosystem will fail.  Moreover the Crimean peninsula perfectly proves the necessity of incorporation  of the historical and cultural changes of landscapes in order to understand  their development and dynamics for a better and appropriate management.</p>
        <p><strong>Key words</strong>:  Crimean peninsula, biodiversity, landscape evolution.<br />

            <strong>Abstract </strong>-  This material addresses the topic of regional disparities. The ground for the  study is offered by the classical work made by <em>J. G. Williamson (1965)</em>,  who examined first on a wide base the development-dependency of regional  differences. Former researches (<em>Nemes-Nagy, J. 1987</em>) have basically  confirmed this relationship, probably making the course of development of  regional inequalities more exact since having the available new information.  The author concludes that the <em>alternative is still opened</em> both in social  and in spatial sense for Hungary  and for countries following the same course: the endurable differentiated &ldquo;<em>European</em>&rdquo;  way and the more polarised, by crises frequently affected &ldquo;<em>Latin-American</em>&rdquo;  way.</p>
        <p><strong>Key words</strong>: regional  inequalities, transition, polarised development.<br />

            <strong>Abstract </strong>-<strong> </strong>In this paper we  highlight the major changes in land use during the transition from the  centralised to the market economy (1989-2005). Agricultural de-collectivisation  and privatisation have caused major structural changes in land uses with direct  effects upon the quality of the environment. An urban area appeared around the  metropolis where the most important environmental changes took place by dint of  those from agriculture, because of agricultural policies and urban expansion.  Within the interior ring of the metropolitan area several regional disparities  have been highlighted. These are caused by the unequal development of its  southern and southeastern areas, on the one hand, and of the western area, on  the other hand. </p>

            <strong>Abstract  -</strong><strong> </strong>When using regional geographic  approaches, i.e. when applying its concepts to the problems of anthropic  communities from a certain territory, is compulsory. In this study we have  taken into account the complex and the etymologically adequate meaning of the  notion and not the meaning most commonly used at present (i.e. the functional  zoning and regionalisation of the territory). Relying on the estimations of  territorial surveys, one may give the solutions for the extant malfunctions and  for optimising future developments. The geographic components of this parameter  (the territorial survey) are: the natural support basis, the population and its  settlements, the social and economic development level, the technical equipment  of the territory, and the extant risks and malfunctions. Indices from 1 to 10  will be summed in order to give us the big picture, namely the present-day  situation and the favourability level of that territory for various anthropic  interventions. </p>
        <p><strong>Key words: </strong>territorial survey,  natural support basis, the technical infrastructure of the territory,  resilience, geographic components.<strong></strong><br />

          Abstract - The main  goal of this paper is to offer an analysis about the urban development  strategies in Romania.  The focus will be on the transition period (after 1989). Although we can not  abstract the outcomes of the urban strategies from the previous period, when  the communist state regulation had full controll on the urban policy.  Urbanisation was the main goal of communist developments based on the idea of  modernisation of the society. Therefore we will offer a brief overwiew of the  communiste urban planning strategies. It has been resulted an unbalanced urban  hierarchy dominated by the capital city of Bucharest and with a weak level of small  cities both in terms of functions and infrastructure. The change of the  political system in 1989 has established a new environment for the urban system  in Romania,  marked by the EU and NATO integration process, by the further globalisation of  the romanian economy, privatisation and liberalisation of the urban land- and  housing market, decentralisation and growth of the weight and importance of  local level. Under this circumctances a new urban development strategy has  evolved based on the following elements: a) development of a polycentric and  balanced urban system, diminishing the overhelming role of Bucharest and  reinforcing the second level of urban centres and the level of small cities; b)  a new urbanisation wave has started in 2002, where the main aim is the declaration  of new towns. It relies on the fact, that in 1997 the dominant internal  migration form became the urban-rural migration, without precedent in the  modern history of Romania  and therefore the urban population of the country is declining. As result the  urbanisation level fo the EU candidate country Romania is well behind the EU level  (52%), a situation which should be mastered by the new strategy of  urbanisation.</p>

  <strong>The Role of the Integrated Network Concept in  Elaborating the Territorial Development Choremes. Case Study: the Peri-Urban  Zone of the Municipium of Bistri&#355;a</strong><br />

            <strong>ABSTRACT - </strong>The choreme is a pattern of high generalization and abstracting  concerning the status, the dynamics and the way of organizing a territory. This  foreshadows territorial patterns in implementing the future anthropic  structures, the evolutive directions of settlements, the best areas for  developing and the critical ones, which claim specific measures of  rehabilitation, the areas with some potential in development and the  underdeveloped ones. Working out the choreme pattern of development relies on a  series of theories (the theory of polarized space, the network theory, the  theory of force axis, the theory of the rising poles, the theory of behavior,  the clusters theory, and the fractals theory), and concepts of development (the  concepts of system, region, potential, norms, sustainable development,  discontinuation, stability, and the resource concept) aiming at scientific  grounding the territorial transforming actions. The summary of these theories  and concepts which are at the basis of territorial development concretize  themselves in a new innovating concept of development &ndash; the concept of  integrated network or the polarized space. The concept of integrated network  represents, in thinking the organizing of the territory, an operational component,  having the role of a vector in delimitating and establishing the locations of  different categories of geographical territorial systems, which are natural or  anthropic, already existent or in the making.&nbsp; </p>

            <strong>Abstract - </strong>In soil studies the idea of regionalisation was introduced  for the proper use of agricultural and forest territory. Initially, pedoregions  were considered to be groups of areas adequate for various land uses or  advantageous for various agricultural crops. As part of these territorial  units, the dominant or the associated soils had the some origins, features, and  productivity.</p>

            <strong>Abstract -</strong><strong> </strong>From the point of view of trans-border  co-operations, the inventory of the regional socio- economic relationships is  indispensable for an exhaustive empirical study. Through this study we only  begin to understand the demographic tendencies in Satu  Mare County  (Romania) and Szabolcs-Szatm&aacute;r-Bereg County  (Hungary)  in order to highlight the main features of the most important resource &ndash; the  human capital. The analysis of the main indicators refers, first of all, to the  vital statistics, population migration, and the demographic structure. Although  the economical periphery-status of the Hungarian side is not valid for the  Romanian side &ndash; because Satu Mare County is a medium-developed, while Bihor  County is an advanced region in Romania &ndash; the demographic periphery status is  fitting to the two Romanian counties, and because the relative positive tendencies,  the Hungarian counties have a quite good demographical position in comparison  with other regions in Hungary. That is why we have to face a kind of  contradiction because the lack of spatial interference between demographical,  positional and economical peripheries. At the Hungarian side the most  disadvantageous subregions from social point of view are those lying next to  the border line, while in Romania  the border area is the most urbanized and developed subregion. The relative  good demographical situation in Hungary  in great part is a consequence of the presence of the numerous Gipsy  population, which in the same time represents a major reason of the  disadvantaged demographic-structural indicators, such as educational level or  infant-mortality.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash; </strong>Our paper researches the economic and social causes  which turned Baia Mare, Bor&#351;a-Vi&#351;eu, and Rodna into disadvantaged zones, the  initial and the extant legislation, the decision-making factors, the desiderata  of the national and regional policy, and their consequences. This paper claims to identify <em>the mechanism of a key phenomenon</em> that has led to the appearance of  several economic and, implicitly, social problems specific to the disadvantaged  areas (the reform of the mining sector). It also claims to answer a very  frequent question in the last 15 years: &ldquo;What are the development desiderata  and alternatives?&rdquo; for the disadvantaged areas of northern Romania  from the North-Western Development Region: Baia Mare, Vi&#351;eu-Bor&#351;a, and Rodna.  The economy of these areas is characterized by the dominance of the industrial  activities and the underdevelopment of the service sector. This is why the loss  of jobs in industry has been significant at the level of the local communities  and has led to chronic economic and social imbalance (e.g. degraded economic  development, long-term unemployment, the deterioration of the living  standards). As we have pointed out in a previous study (Ilovan, 2005c), the  economic rehabilitation of these disadvantaged mining zones has been possible  only by granting them the status of &ldquo;disadvantaged area&rdquo;. At present, the  &ldquo;assisted zones&rdquo; appear as an alternative to the disadvantaged areas where the  fiscal facilities have disappeared. This leads to a status of normal  functionality, observing the laws of competition. This way the implementation  of several programmes with the involvement of local communities will eliminate  the above-mentioned flaws and will solve the extant economic and social  problems of these areas. </p>

            <strong>Trends of Industrial Reconversion in the Land  of the Mo&#355;i </strong><br />

            <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash; </strong>Our paper presents an example of a regional  development strategy where wood industry and mining still ensure the  functionality of the region. The strategy we have presented may be expanded to  territories where industrial reconversion has called for the breaking up of  traditional economic branches.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
          We have concluded that the economic specificity of the Land of the <em>Mo&#355;i</em> relies on these two industrial branches (mining and wood processing), even if,  some severe restructuring has been taking place.</p>

  <strong>The Regionalisation of Natural Risks in the  Some&#351;ul Mare Hills </strong><br />

            <strong>Abstract</strong><strong> - </strong>The significance of  studying natural risks derives from the human society&rsquo;s necessity to live safely.  This approach is at its best if the analysis is undertaken at a micro-scale,  i.e. through regionalisation, which supposes the complex treatment of all its  environmental components and the study of all the phenomena taking place in it.  Most of the risk phenomena result from the interaction of many factors, each of  them with different and specific laws, and evolution trends. The  regionalisation of risks is necessary as it leads to highlighting the phenomena  on certain risk-friendly areas. Because of the complexity of the natural and  the anthropic factors, the Some&#351;ul Mare Hills are a favourable environment for  the evolution of the geographic risk phenomena; hence the necessity of the  regional analysis of those phenomena. </p>
        <p><strong>Key words</strong>: natural risks, genetic factors, regionalisation.</p>
