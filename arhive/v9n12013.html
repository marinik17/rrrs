          <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> - Space is a concept that acquired  in time new meanings shifting it from concrete to abstract and adding or  subtracting dimensions. Even the geographical space is now claimed as object of  study by other disciplines, such as ecology or spatial planning. Along with the  concept of &ldquo;space&rdquo;, these sciences discovered the potential of geographical  approaches, especially of the techniques based on using the Geographical  Information Systems, and consequently maps found applications even beyond  conventional spaces. The paper examines several mapping approaches, used by  other disciplines or even by geography, which go beyond or distort the  geographical reality, in an attempt to test the hypothesis according to which  such methodological imports were productive for the recipient disciplines. The  analysis of six approaches (bacterial geography, time space analyses, spatial  interpolation maps, bubble maps, body viewer, and network maps) confirms the  hypothesis, but underlines the need for caution in interpreting the results in  relationship with the territorial reality, especially when unconventional maps  are drawn over the real space.</p>

          <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash;</strong> Regional economy is usually  affected by the operation and interaction of environment and human beings in  geographical spaces. Warm and dry areas create special economic conditions,  which have particular functions, quite different from the characteristics of  humid and cold hilly areas or those of the Mediterranean areas. The Sistan  Region is located in South East of Iran. Until recent droughts (1999-2005),  agriculture sector was the basis of all economic activities in Sistan area, a  major share of rural as well as urban income came directly and indirectly from  agricultural activities. In accordance with the latest census before the  drought period (1996), about 55 percent of the rural population directly  depended on the agriculture sector for their income and employment. In addition,  almost 24 percent of rural population was depended to cottage and rural  industries for their employments. In urban areas, 70 percent of population was  linked to service sector as a source of employment. The results of this  research show that the environmental changes resulting from drought in Sistan  area have had deep impacts on the socio-economic factors in the region. It is  clearer in the Hamoon Lake area, which, before the onset drought, had produced  crops like fodders, mat, bird meat and fish. The livestock sector also suffered  to a great extent. Out of the total of 1.6 million livestock units in the area,  more than 0.5 million remained in the production cycle nowadays. The production  of these crops reduced to zero with drought. The total direct loss resulted  from the drought amounts to 14,057,332 million Rails or 1,561 billion US$. To  sum up, the environmental changes resulting from drought caused more than 80  percent of agricultural and livestock activities in the region come to halt,  which, in turn, due to a reduced income multiplier effect of agriculture sector  resulted in greater damage to socio-economic factors in rural, as well as in  urban areas.</p>

          <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> &ndash; The efficient management of water resources  is vital for a community, because water is both a precious &rdquo;good&rdquo; and a  strategic element in the process of spatial planning<strong>. </strong>It is not the abundance or scarcity of this resource that  dictates the level of development in a territory, but the skills of local  &rdquo;actors&rdquo; to participate to an adequate utilisation strategy, without  compromising it.<strong> </strong>The aim of this study  is to analyze the spatial distribution of the water resources in the regional  system of the Land of F&#259;g&#259;ra&#537;, which are considered to be one of the most  valuable natural resources in the territory. We focused our research on  presenting the potential of the surface water, particularly the hydrographical  network and the artificial lakes, but also the underground reservoirs, all in  relation to access to the centralized supply system and the production of  hydropower. Indicators of social welfare, such as the amount of water  distributed for household needs per capita from the total amount of water  distributed through the supply network were calculated in relation to household  consumers. Finally, we concluded that an efficient management of water  resources should necessarily involve partnerships between localities positioned  above the same underground reservoirs or those using the same surface sources.</p>

          <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> &ndash; The article presents the  diversity and changes in the emission of typical pollutant gases: CO, SOx  and NOx in the selected European Union countries in the years  1995-2010. This process was determined to be diverse both in time and space.  There was an evident decrease in the total emission of the above-mentioned pollutants  also in some countries with a dynamics higher in the years 1995-2000 than in  the first decade of the 21st century. The highest actual emission of  the analyzed pollutants took place in Poland, Bulgaria and Romania, with the  lowest values in Slovenia, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia. In the years  1995-2010, the disproportions between the countries in the spatial  diversification of air pollution emission considerably diminished. One of the  consequences of the decline in the air pollution emission is an improvement of  air quality in numerous urbanized and industrialized areas in the research  countries.</p>

          <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash;</strong> The current  development of the European Union is based on the cohesion policy which focuses  on the attenuation of regional disparities. For this purpose, the idea of  growth poles emerged in Romania, and its role became more than familiar: the  determination of an internal socio-economic cohesion. Polycentrism becomes a  concept of territorial planning increasingly promoted. Development of growth  poles aims to reduce the attraction force of large centres and to balance the  location of activities generating functions across a territory. This was the  idea that led to the formation of Ia&#351;i Metropolitan Area, territorial unit that  is intended to be the main regional centre of the North-East Region, thus  polarizing the surrounding areas. Ia&#351;i Growth Pole objectives are represented  by economic competitiveness, the development of regional connectivity and the  promotion of regional cooperation. One of the major assets of the growth pole  in achieving these goals is the cross-border position near the eastern border  of the European Union. This paper examines to what extent Ia&#537;i Growth Pole can rise  to the required standards, while the peripheral position seems to be rather a  disadvantage and the uncertain functionality of the metropolitan area shows  that the main problem remains the reduced economic competitiveness.</p>

          <strong>ABSTRACT - </strong>This paper gives an insight into the  statistical interpretation of socio-spatial changes of Bucharest urban  landscape in connection to the transformations of the urban planning visions  across the last decades. Special emphasis is placed on the emergence of  disadvantaged neighbourhoods which are defined by a clear homogenisation of  certain social classes on a precarious housing infrastructure. This came as a  result of a historical hierarchy of the urban social space. Moreover, Bucharest  was shaped in relation to different socio-economic and socio-cultural policies  that determined the creation of a polarisation between north and south or  between centre and periphery which were subject to numerous socio-urban  inversions during the communist and post-communist eras. Hence, life in a large  metropolis is vulnerable to inequalities appearing within the urban pattern  that intensifies, in some cases, towards residential segregation. The  historical-geographical analysis of vectors behind clusters of sensitive areas  in the 20th and 21st centuries strengthens the importance  of social cohesion measures in the future urban policies and territorial  planning.</p>

  <strong>Spatial Patterns of Underdevelopment in  Maramure&#351; - Chioar Region, Romania</strong><br />

          <strong>ABSTRACT - </strong>This  article approaches aspects of spatial patterns associated with underdevelopment  situations in Maramure&#351; &ndash; Chioar Region, Romania. Based on the concept  according to which territorial balance results from a harmonization between  structure and function, the analysis performed considers three territorial  aspects: the road network, the economic characteristics and the spatial  positioning of the human settlements. The correlated analysis of these aspects  allowed capturing certain recurrent spatial situations of association between  settlements without business organizations, with a poor road network  development. Such situations, translated in terms of space as patterns of  underdevelopment, are, due to the big number of cases, a symptom of uneven  regional development. We have identified three classes of spatial patterns  associated with economic underdevelopment situations: the sidewise pattern, the  cul-de-sac pattern, and the proximity pattern. The analysis of network  indicators (&alpha;, &beta;, &gamma;, &mu;) and of a compound indicator (&kappa;) reveals in many cases  that the identified spatial patterns coincide with low values of road network  connectivity. From a systemic point of view, the significance of these  indicators derives from the fact that they signal dysfunctions manifested at  structural and functional level. The optimization of the patterns of  underdevelopment requires both a harmonious relationship between road network  meshes and nodes and an efficient network flow transmission, i.e. an  optimization between time, space and consumed energy factors. Under these  conditions, the emergence of new structural elements and network segments that  will close the non-functional network meshes can be a possible solution that  might eliminate underdevelopment situations by increasing the positional value  of these settlements.</p>

          <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash; </strong>The economic convergence and the effects of the  economic crisis is a very popular research question.<strong> </strong>In this paper I propose to examine the convergence process in  Central and Eastern Europe by testing the Williamson hypothesis form a  multiscalar perspective: at national and at different regional levels as well.  By using time series for the GDP per capita, I will try to answer three basic  issues: firstly, the trends in convergence/divergence in Central and Eastern  Europe, secondly, which convergence clubs have evolved in the analysed space,  and, finally, the effects of the financial and economic crisis on the  convergence process. </p>

          <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> - In this article we  use the classic economic variable, the Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita  in order to investigate the economic convergence between regions in Romania and  between the Romanian regions and EU in the period 2000&ndash;2010. The main results  confirm that while there is an evident convergence between the country as whole  and EU, the inter-regional disparities in Romania has widened, confirming the  Williamson hypothesis.</p>

          <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash;</strong> Starting from the  offer of the experience economy &ndash; the experience &ndash; we took into account the  hypothesis that the &ldquo;lands&rdquo; of Romania hosted enough goods, products, and services  that one might use in order to create experiences and tourism based on  commercialising experiences. We concluded that, first of all, the experience  economy offered the means for creating not only a touristic phenomenon, but also  the entire development characterised by environmental, social (including  cultural), and economic sustainability. In this context, integrating the &ldquo;lands&rdquo;  in the practice of the experience  economy could be done through promoting folkloric, architectural, historical,  and cultural or ethnographic brands that people could capitalize. Secondly, territorial  cohesion, diminishing social and economic disparities and preventing further  lagging behind of the &ldquo;land&rdquo; type regions could be ensured only if the  political and administrative factors perceived the opportunity offered by  tourism correctly and in due time.</p>

          <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> - Local food crops are believed to be important alternatives in facing  the problems of continuously growing price of food stuff worldwide. There has  been a strong bias in national agricultural development policy towards the  production of rice as staple food in Indonesia. Local food crops have been  neglected in the agricultural development policy in the last 50 years, leading  to the dependency on imported commodities and creating a vulnerability in the  national food security. This paper aims at assessing the factors constraining  local food production in Indonesia based on empirical experiences drawn from a  research in Kulon Progo Regency, Yogyakarta Province. The government of Kulon  Progo Regency has declared its commitment in the development of local food  commodities as a part of its agricultural development policy, as it is  mentioned in the long-term and medium-term development planning documents.  There is also a head regency decree mandating the use of local food commodities  in any official events organized by the government organisations. The research shows that there are at least six  policy-related problems and nine technical factors constraining local food  crops production in the regency. Some of the policy-related and structural  factors hampering the production of local food crops consist of (1) long-term  policy biases towards rice, (2) strong biases on rice diet in the community,  (3) difficulties in linking policy to practices, (4) lack of information on  availability of local food crops across the regency and (5) external threat from  the readily available instant food on local market and (6) past contra-productive  policy to the production of local food crops. The  technical factors constraining local food production comprises (1) inferiority  of the food stuff versus the instantly prepared food, (2) difficulty in  preparation and risk of contagion of some crops, lack of technology for  processing, (3) continuity of supply (some crops are seasonally available), (4)  low production and productivity level and (5) lack of knowledge on production  and processing, (6) lack of skills and knowledge among the young people to grow  the crops, (7)  higher price as a result of commodity scarcity in the market, (8) attitudes  towards local food commodities as secondary products, and (9) bias of  information in marketing whereas local market is very small.</p>

          <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash;</strong> This article aims to highlight the relevance  of the territory in the experience of local development. Indeed, by an application  on a Tunisian case, it was shown  that the territory of Ksar-Hellal  is implicated in the functioning of its  local production system, specializing in textile and clothing. It turned out  that the Hilalian territory is abundant in specific economic resources such as  competition, complementarity, and non-economic such as cooperation,  technological externalities and social values. Those resources that are  specific to the Hilalian territory are essential to stimulate the local  dynamics of the productive system in question.</p>

          <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash;</strong> Based on  previous works on the connectivity index applied to the settlements of Banat  (Rusu, 2007; Rusu, 2008), the paper assesses the road connectivity index for  the same settlements using a slightly different approach, based on the road  distance from every settlement to the nearest central places, ranked on nine  levels. Therefore, it is not the position on a certain road that counts, but the  means by which specific groups of people (either urban or rural communities)  might access a set of services or facilities deemed socially necessary and  located in the above-mentioned central places. The welfare of the communities  depends mainly on the standards of connectivity and accessibility to such  services or facilities. We considered that the most valid measure of  connectivity would then be the assessment of the space (distance) needed to be  crossed for the population of every settlement to reach specific destinations.  The overall values for each settlement have been interpolated using GIS in  order to produce a map of the road connectivity index in Banat. The map clearly  shows the existing disparities between well-connected regions, especially  around the main cities, and isolated areas, usually in the mountains, the hills  or along the borders. </p>
