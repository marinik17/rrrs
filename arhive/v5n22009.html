            <strong>ABSTRACT - </strong>This study is a  continuation of research on deeply disadvantaged areas, adding new elements to  finalise a methodology in their treatment field. It also brings practical  elements related to the individualisation of the main territorial  discontinuities at the level of some problem areas for all the development  regions of Romania.  The basic hypothesis is that in the treatment process of deeply disadvantaged  areas, knowing the gaps within them is of utmost importance. These gaps are  highlighted by physiognomic, functional and especially by mental  discontinuities. The indicators used and the amendment with qualitative  indicators may lead to the individualisation of such discontinuities, which  separates the very poor areas among the poor ones. Possessing such territorial  partitions, the transition to their characterization and of insertion  environment is easy, in order to assess the real possibilities of future development.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash;</strong> The so called Visegrad countries have different  regional planning approach and tradition, but thanks to this colourful pattern, Romanian regional planning may learn  from results gained by analyzing the current 2007-2013 programming period  context. The paper argues that there is a major need for a detailed comparative  analysis in this respect in favour of preparing planning capacities for the  period after 2014.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> - The abolishment of the communist regime, the  establishment of a democratic legal and institutional system brought important  changes in the development of the regional economy of Romania. The old &ndash; from  an economic point of view &ndash; differentiating factors have lost some of their  importance, mainly the level of industrialization, which, in the past, was used  to measure economic development. In addition, other factors came forward, that  correlate more with the economic capacity, but, nowadays, their positive effect  can only be increased by the combination of several other factors: foreign  investments, as an indicator of regional attractiveness, regional GDP, the  level of personal income, and the appreciation of human resources. Today, in  the interest of enhancing the competitiveness of the regions a special role is  reserved for entrepreneurial activity, the strength of the SME sector, the role  of foreign working capital in the local economy, but also the territorial  concentration of R&amp;D centers. The study focuses on some aspects of  disparities regarding the regional economic structure.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT - </strong>In the sustainable  development context, waste management is seen as a major problem, which cannot  be solved only by using technical means; a fundamental change is necessary in  the current production, consumption and waste elimination pattern. Our study  refers to the environmental impact of the closure of the urban Titu- D&acirc;mbovi&#355;a  solid waste dump, and comprises: quality of the environmental factors, analysis  of the size of the impact, evaluation of the potential impact on the  environmental factors, evaluation of the global impact and post-closure  monitoring of the waste dump. The results obtained concerning the value of the  global pollution index and the bonitation grades for each environmental factor  have led us to state that through the closure of this solid domestic waste  dump, environment is affected within allowable limits, the impact is low and  local, and the effects of this project on the environmental factors are  positive.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash;</strong> The efficient territorial management represents a  necessity of topical interest, both at regional and at local level. In the  conditions of an increasing pressure upon the localities&rsquo; built-up areas,  unsustainable forms of their extension are frequently adopted to the prejudice  of the land outside the built-up areas. The physical-geographical  characteristics and the economic peculiarities of the Maramure&#351; &ndash;Chioar region  have generated the existence of some land categories that can represent an  outlet in rapport with the space crisis. It refers to the brownfield lands,  whose functional reintegration within the territory must represent a constant  preoccupation for the local and regional authorities. The possible alternatives  for reintegration have in view the re-valorization of the respective lands,  both through their ecologization and through associating some necessary and  desirable territorial functions. At local level, <em>the adoption of a development direction based on compact spatial  patterns</em> and <em>on the preferable and  priority use of brownfield lands</em> is necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT - </strong>The infrastructural conditions  of villages have important role, but they are not enough in themselves for the  success of a certain village. Those local communities that can be described as  cooperative, have a stronger ability to enforce interests. Additionally, their  local and social dividedness is lower. If a village has a strong community,  which can communicate and assert their interests, it can solve the  infrastructural problems of the village. <br />
          The positive social relations make the village more attractive for the  locals and for those individuals who would like to settle down there. On the  other hand, social conflicts are poisoning the local relationships and are  hindering the formation and the operation of the community life. </p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT -</strong> The morphological  component plays an important role in the evolution of a specific land region.  The relief has greatly contributed to setting up the limits of the region, it  has favourized and imposed certain paths of development and land use while  playing the support role for all the other components and phenomena. The  morphological component has also acted as a physical support, favourizing  intense humanization (the hollow&rsquo;s guard). However, we should not miss out on  the housing function it had during several critical periods, the role it played  in preserving and increasing the human element, all of which have greatly  contributed to the apparition and permanence of the Land of Lovi&#351;tea within the  national territory.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash; </strong>The increasing in the number of secondary residences  is a phenomenon which has affected the rural space of Romania after 1990,  especially in the mountain area. In order to emphasize its impact, the present  paper studies the case of villages in the Gil&#259;u-Muntele Mare Mountains. By  studying the bibliography and the statistical data we got the general picture  of this case and by interviewing regional and local authorities the real extent  of the matter revealed. It resulted that in this area, secondary residences  phenomena led to spatial and functional impact upon rural space and to social  and economic consequences on local communities: secondary residences transform  rural space into one with tourist characteristics: implantation of a suite of  secondary residences, the local councils collect more taxes but also deal with  overwhelmed facilities and pollution, while the native people copy a different  lifestyle. In some cases, ownership transfer towards city residents or the  small villages taken over by non-resident people speak of the extreme  transformation of the rural space.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT - </strong>The development of  rural tourism in the Iza Valley Microregion, Maramure&#351; Depression, is based on  a wide natural and anthropogenic potential. The main types of rural tourism in  the region are cultural tourism and recreational tourism. Due to the fact that  the tourism in the Iza Valley Microregion is seasonal, with an intense traffic  in winter and summer, it is vital to have diversity in approaches of promoting  tourist products and services so that rural tourism be present all around the  year. Although it has a rich tourist potential, the rural tourist consumption  presents an uneven distribution in time and space; only some of the villages  have a significant number of pensions and tourist services. This is due to the  lack of information of the rural population regarding the ways of promotion, as  noticed by some surveys conducted by AJOFM. Following these surveys there were  courses for informing people and for re-qualification. <br />
          The promotion of the tourist products in the region,  by different strategies, can influence the development of the rural tourism  both in the localities where this type of tourism is already present and in the  localities where the rural tourism is at an initial stage.<br />
          The choice of promotion strategies is conditioned by  the target market, the objective and the strategies of promotion. </p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash; </strong>The transition period represents for the Sub-Carpathians between the Olt  and the Jiu Rivers, relatively to areas with similar socio-economic problematic  during the transition period (the south-western piedmont area and the Petro&#351;ani  Depression), from a social point of view and by means of the impact of the  changes in the support area, a period of &ldquo;discreet or tacit convulsions&rdquo; as  regards the &rsquo;60s and the &rsquo;80s. The dynamic of the given region during the  transition period reveals the facts that certain convulsions or restructurings  do not necessarily have to possess explicit static or striking forms in the  modification of the landscapes in order to allow the transparency of the  problematic period these regions have crossed. The current paper presents  certain aspects (the economic dependency, the demographic aging, the  unemployment rate, the need of social protection, the illiteracy, etc.)  characterizing the present situation of the demographic component with impact  on the development as result of the crossing of this transition period. The  aspects presented in the current paper are the result of the analysis of the  statistical data regarding the discussed indicators and of a more ample field  research carried out in order to assert the transformations suffered in the  studied area during the transition period, from the perspective of social  geography.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> - The South-Muntenia Development Region can be  characterized by major differences between the districts that compose it. This  situation reverberates on the level of the tourist activity, from tourist  potential point of view, as well as technical and town endowment or tourist  traffic. The biggest differences are between the north district, more developed  from tourist point of view, being helped by the variety of the relief&rsquo;s aspect,  and the ones from the south of the region, that are not so developed, with a  small landscape architecture and investment attractiveness.</p>
        <p><strong>Key words</strong>: tourism, development region, regional  differences<br />
