            <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> - Several  peculiarities make Ia&#351;i an outstanding city: it is a first-rank city in the  national settlement system and the capital of the historical province of  Moldova, numbers over 300,000 inhabitants and holds the 2nd position in the  national urban hierarchy by demographic size, and a national growth pole since  2008 (Government Decision 998/2008). In view of the above, Ia&#351;i has a  significant demographic potential, also discharging complex functions and  polarizing a large influence area, being one of the pillars of urban  development in Romania. The aim of this paper is to outline the urban  development strategy in the light of demographic structures and evolution. The  demography today in the peri-urban space shows two characteristic features,  namely the urban&ndash;rural migration, on the one hand, and the dominant  agricultural functionality, on the other hand, as mirrored by the structure of  employment. The development&ndash;related factors are the positive natural  demographic balance, low level of population ageing and supply of a large  workforce, a potential well-balanced local labour market. Concluding, the  provision of Ia&#351;i  integrated urban and peri-urban strategy are pointed out.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> - Rural  development, namely the LEADER program, plays an important role in reducing  regional disparities in catching up backward regions not only in Hungary but also in Romania. The study, or the lecture,  is going to focus on those essential elements in which member States have wide  competence and the different decision making options basically affect and even  determine the success of the implementation. In case of the LEADER program, the  definition of the demarcation criteria of geographic coverage, size, form of  organization, planning, staff procedures, and various community programs can be  regarded as such element. The presentation and knowledge of the Hungarian experience  can contribute to a more successful implementation of the Romanian LEADER or  rural development program and to avoiding the errors that have occurred in the  Hungarian program.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> - The objective of this paper is to analyze new forms of local  territorial partnerships developed under the territorial cohesion policy  promoted by the European Union.&nbsp;In this context, the future of cohesion  policy and the growing importance of territorial cohesion led to the initiating  of the micro-regional projects in order to reduce economic and social  disparities. The promotion of regional policies based on local agreement is  dedicated to create partnerships in order to start projects for local development  that involve civil society, municipalities, regions, private sector, experts,  or private citizens. These partnerships are presented as informal  organizations, created by cooperation at local level of public institutions,  with social and economic actors stated aim to develop community consistently  using all the resources offered by their territory. Such forms of cooperation  can be found in several places in the world, but with a greater focus in  Europe, and their main purpose is to promote community participation and  sustainable development, engaging citizens and organizations in taking  decisions at local level. The study aims to clarify the concept of &ldquo;local  action group&rdquo; and to analyse the effects of public - private partnership on  territorial development for the project initiated in the H&acirc;rl&#259;u region. This  project groups 12 administrative-territorial units from Ia&#351;i County, developed  with the support from the European program LEADER.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> - The measuring of human  capital, human development from both a quantitative and a qualitative point of  view is difficult, the problem being further complicated if we consider  regional and territorial approaches as well. At  an international level, the Human Development Index is usually used for  measuring and comparing these issues. This index  addresses the most complex level of development of a region through the  aggregation of the three indices from demographic (life expectancy at birth),  social (education level) and the economic sphere (GDP per capita) with which we  can have a much more complex picture about living standards of the population  as well as the development level of a country.&nbsp;  Because the applicability of this index has caused serious  debates since its introduction, this study also  focuses on selecting the right indicators for measuring human development. </p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT  -</strong>There are the so called most  disadvantageous or MD micro-regions. The Hungarian government and the regional  development institution system has worked out an own development programme for  the improvement of these regions. The Southern Transdanubian Regional  Development Council was established in 1998.The investigation focuses on the 8  most disadvantageous micro-regions of Southern   Transdanubia. The micro-regional level in Hungary was  determined on statistical and not on administrative consideration. The degree of social-economic underdevelopment under Hungarian  circumstances is reflected by indicators of economy, infrastructure, society,  sociality, and employment. The most disadvantaged micro-regions are qualified  as beneficiary micro-regions. The 8 micro-regions of the Southern   Transdanubian related to environmental development can be  subsidized in the framework of the regional operational programme from the  presumable resources of the micro-regions: economic development (business  infrastructure), settlement development (function-expanding settlement  development), environmental development (sewage, water management).<strong> </strong></p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> - This paper  presents the main dysfunctions encountered in a microsystem, in this case, the  one of Chinteni Commune, as well as the measures proposed for the  revitalization of the analyzed area and the outlining of a functional space of  reduced dimensions. The identification and the analysis of the dysfunctions  were realized based on several differentiated indicators, in order to be able  to apprehend, as well as possible, the reality of the territory. The  encountered dysfunctions were classified into four groups: dysfunctions of the  natural environment, dysfunctions of the human resource and of the settlement,  economic dysfunctions and dysfunctions related to infrastructure. The  conclusions have proved the necessity of implementing several solutions that  will lead to a desirable state of the microsystem of Chinteni Commune. </p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT - </strong>The geoecological  complexity of the Trasc&#259;u   Mountains is revealed not  only by means of its natural components but also by means of its existing  interactions and inter-dependences with the anthropic elements identified  within the region. The current paper represents an overview and a small scale  analysis of the existing types of geosystems identified in the southern part of  the Trasc&#259;u Mountains, mainly along the Ampoi River valley, as well as of the  type of the existing interactions between the anthropic elements with the  natural environment materialized by means of land utilization carried out in  order to sustain the existence and development of agricultural activities, as a  basis for the development of the local communities. Throughout the time, the  human communities have modified the natural environment in such a manner that  they have altered the nature&rsquo;s ability to restore its initial equilibrium, many  of the current types of landforms (especially those located alongside the water  courses) being modified as result of the man&rsquo;s interference. The development of  the human communities resulted in an increase of the demand for more resources  which materialized in an increase in the cultivated surfaces, development of  more settlements, and modification of the land utilization with a more  pronounced development of crops to the detriment of the natural vegetation. In  regards to the existing human settlements, the spreading of the households  along the Ampoi River valley and along its tributaries  can be observed, the villages thus possessing a congregate shape. </p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT - </strong>Many Romanian cities are confronted with difficulties  regarding the insertion of redundant industrial objectives in the present urban  landscape. This study focuses on two industrial units that have created a  certain place identity through time, both undergoing a conversion process, due  to relict or underused industrial structures. These industrial units are  reclaimed by the increasingly public demand for new construction spaces that  are more adapted to the cultural, social, economic and ecological context.  Belvedere Cigarette Factory was an important factory in Bucharest because it initiated the tobacco  manufacturing in the Romanian capital city. The buildings of the cigarette  factory, which were constructed from the late 19th century until the  early 20th century, are considered heritage objectives. Currently,  some factory buildings and annexes are demolished and in their place shopping  and entertainment spaces have been built.&nbsp;  S.C. MEFIN S.A. Sinaia was established on a pre-existing industrial unit  in 1953 and in 2007 it was decided to be integrated into the services sector  (tourist accommodation, commercial spaces, sports and leisure) in order to  raise the attractiveness of the area. However, the transformation of this unit  cannot be dissociated from the community`s preferences regarding the area`s  revitalization (Stan A, 2009, p. 201). The methods applied in this study are  the case study research and the survey that allows the comparison of the reuse  perception of the industrial units. The need to return these productive areas  to the urban context recognizes people (residents) as active participants in  the revitalization process of industrial landscapes </p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash;</strong> The city,  depending on its size, represents a pole of attraction for different groups of  people situated both near and far from the city. The causes that lead to the  movement towards the city of the population living in the rural area are  related to a more developed economic activity, the possibility of finding a job  (especially for middle-aged persons), the presence of learning institutions,  hospitals, cultural centres and better living conditions. The city&rsquo;s power of  attraction is proportional to its size: the larger the city, the more people  come to it from great distances or smaller cities whilst a small city attracts  only the population from the neighbouring settlements. Presently, in large  cities the population shifts from the urban area towards the rural one through  the development of the suburban settlements and residential districts. For the  city of Pite&#351;ti,  this migration is available thus in its peripheral districts as residential  neighbourhoods appeared within the adjacent settlements, a fact which caused  the decline of the city population opposite to the growth of the rural  population. A major influence on the evolution of the city&rsquo;s population is the  natural movement of the population and the industrial restructuration, which  forced the affected population to move to the rural area or to work in a  foreign country. Between 1990 and 2010, the city&rsquo;s population recorded three  evolution periods: a slight growth between 1990 and 1997, followed by a period  of stagnation between 1997 and 2001, and a period of regression between 2002  and 2009. These periods were influenced by the economic activities, which  initially grew then declined, by the natural movement of the population and the  migration towards adjacent settlements or across the borders.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> &ndash; Catholics represent almost 5% of the total population of Moldavia. Their  spiritual identity was formed in opposition to that of the Orthodox majority  and according to the universal church dogmata, preached by the missionary  priests who reached the territory surrounded by the Carpathians, the Nister,  the Black Sea, the Danube and the Milcov as  early as the 14th century. In the Middle Ages, religion was the  means of differentiating oneself from the others and not ethnicity. Therefore,  the large Catholic communities around Roman and Bac&#259;u,  of mixed ethnic origin (Hungarian and Romanian) and of different ages (due to  the Transcarpathian movement of the population from Transylvania),  considered themselves to be Catholics and nothing else until the modern period.  Once the ideas of nation and nationality appeared, these biethnic groups were  gradually involved in the process of formation of the modern states (Romania and Hungary). The Catholics of other  origins, such as Polish, German, Armenian, Rroma, French and Italian are very  few and some even became completely Romanian, preserving only their religious  identity. As many of the speakers of Hungarian and Romanian (called Csangos by  the Hungarians and the Secklers) lived in Moldavia, it was inevitable for them to  be subjected to a natural process of becoming Romanian, through school, army  and church for the past 150 years. Yet, they managed to preserve unaltered  their laws, customs and superstitions, supported by the active participation in  the spiritual and social life of the community.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> - Romania's population has declined  steadily from 23.2 million in 1990 to 21.5 million inhabitants in 2007. This  overall decline in population is not entirely true for the towns and cities of  the North-East Region, as during the same period they recorded both decreases  and increases in population due to positive natural balance. The North-East  Region (partially superimposed over the historic region of the western Moldova) is  considered the poorest region in the European Union and a disadvantaged area.  The rural young population of Moldova  is a reservoir which supplies urban areas and especially large cities. In these  circumstances, the small towns of the North-East Region are seeking balance  (demographic, economic, functional). This paper examines the demographic  evolution of the small towns located in the area under analysis, in the  post-communist period, illustrating the types of fluctuations in statistical methods  as regards demographic changes and the risk of depopulation in the future,  correlated with a lower overall population of Romania.&nbsp; <br />

            <strong>ABSTRACT - </strong>The quality  of life in urban areas is a function of many parameters among which, one highly  important is the number and quality of green areas for people and wildlife to  thrive. The quality of life is also a political concept often used to describe  citizen satisfaction within different residential locations. Only in the last  decades green areas have suffered a progressive decrease in quality, pointing  out the ecological urban risk with a negative impact on the standard of living  and population health status. This paper presents the evolution of green areas  in the cities of South-Eastern Romania within the last 20 years and sets forth  the current state of quality of life from the perspective of vegetation  reference. By using state-of-the-art processing tools applied on  high-resolution satellite images, we have derived knowledge about the spatial  and temporal expansion of urbanized regions. Our semi-automatic technologies  for analysis of remote sensing data such as Landsat 7 ETM+, correlated with  statistical information inferred from urban charts, demonstrate a negative  trend in the distribution of green areas within the analyzed cities, with  long-term implications on multiple areas in our lives. </p>

If the potential effects are assessed in  terms of exposure, sensitivity, and vulnerability, a GIS methodology, based on  statistical indicators and GIS modelling was used to assess the overall  vulnerability of the Tisza river basin and  define the flood-prone area. Even though specific indicators exhibited high  values in some NUTS III units, the overall vulnerability of the regions appears  to be low.</p>
        <p><strong>Keywords</strong>: clime change, adaptability, vulnerability, Tisza,  CORINE<br />
