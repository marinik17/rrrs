            <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> &ndash; <strong>Reform of Collectivities and  Regionalisation in France:  A Horizon of Variable Geometry</strong>. Initially considered as a highly profitable  solution that best fits the spatial organization of France, the resulted  administrative cutting gave rise to the multiplication of some supra-communal  and intra-departmental structures, contrary to the purpose they had been  created for: socio-economic efficiency, territorial cohesion, as well as to  institutionalisation. What territorial organization in France is lacking at present is  exactly the absence of the interrelations between different territorial levels,  the legislative levers being those that can manage these intra- and extra-regional  relations. The consequences of decentralization, interpreted by the existence  of a multitude of territorial entities between department/county and communes,  non-hierarchized, without assuming any responsibility, can and must be  corrected by legislative regulations, the reform of territorial collectivities  - a regional reform at the same time, left in the hands of Balladur committee,  being one of them. The main directions of territorial organization require a  focus on merging, namely on suppressing the territorial-administrative units  (e.g. canton), the decrease in the number of regional councillors, the  promotion of intercommunal associations, the suppression of regional  assemblies, the equivalence of the number of regions with the number of  regional metropolises, the strengthening of interterritorial relations,  directions found only partially in the Balladur report. <br />

            <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> &ndash; Irrespective of  their univocal or biunivocal structure, gravity axes facilitate the emergence  of nucleation phenomena, the genesis of certain settlements with polarizing  functions of various ranks and hierarchical levels. The formation of the  habitational nuclei takes place in the areas where natural gravity reaches  representative parameters, such as river confluences, depressions and the more  spread out sectors of the river meadows, where a concentration of the vectors  of the geomorphologic evolution is remarked. The nucleation processes follow a  spiral of conditionings, being triggered by the natural facilities and  subsequently amplified by the diversification and the intensification of the  human activities. </p>

          ABSTRACT - The paper analyzes the  role of some societal level factors which determine citizens&rsquo; participation in  environmental non-governmental organizations in the case of ten former  communist European countries, now members of the European Union, based on the  data of the 62.2 Special Eurobarometer. The analysis practically re-verifies on  the case of these countries previous considerations made on the level of very  different states of the world regarding the macro-level determinants of  participation, respectively adds to these previous findings the possible role  of opportunity structures (number of ENGOs) and that of societal trust. Results  confirm the role of the classical factors (national wealth, democratisation and  environmental conditions) on participation. No matter participation have  declined compared to the beginning of the transition period, democratisation  still constitutes a helping force for participation in these countries as far  as it creates the climate and opportunity structures for involvement. It is  however interesting that ENGO participation is much more dependent on a  country&rsquo;s democratic climate than on the number of opportunity structures, in  spite of the fact that the latter is correlated with democratisation. </p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> &ndash; Education is  highly significant for the functional system of a nation, which eventually  reflects the vitality and the real possibilities of development and creates  some potential interrelations at national and continental level. In Romania,  the numbers regarding the educational indicators registered in the last years  reflect a certain state of facts, valid for the entire national area. They  reveal a significant decrease in the number of students for all educational  levels and a precarious qualitative state of school infrastructure and teaching  staff. This phenomenon is becoming more concerning especially in rural areas,  where the threats from this perspective are greatest. <em>The Inner city area of Sinaia-Bu&#351;teni-Azuga-Predeal-R&acirc;&#351;nov-Bra&#351;ov  (Poiana Bra&#351;ov</em>) reflects a similar situation. Therefore, this study reveals  the current complex analysis of the major educational indicators.</p>

  <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash;</strong> In the following  paper aims at studying the evolution of the population size in the Apuseni Mountains during 1880 &ndash; 2008, on  different spatial scales. From the second half of the 20th century, the area  has recorded a continual decrease of the demographic potential, accompanied by  the deterioration of the age group structures because of the increase of the  migratory effect. Following the same downward trend, different subregional  evolutions determined by social and economic factors can be highlighted on the  LAU1 scale (counties) and at the scale of three altitudinal-delimited areas (as  the expression of the increasing limitations of natural agrarian factors). At  the LAU2 scale (communes and towns), on the same decreasing trend, positive  dynamic of the population appears in some towns of the area. However, we found  the most diverse evolutions at the settlement level. In this study, we cover  the demographic evolution of the villages that are commune centres and villages  with population below 50 residents. Both categories highlight spatial and  functional transformations that have occurred and are to take place in the  rural mountain.</p>

  <strong>The Tourist Role of Relief as  Landscape Background </strong><br />

            <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> &ndash; In its relation  with tourism, relief fulfils three roles: of attractive resource, of support  for tourist infrastructure and activities, and of landscape background,  respectively. While the first two undertaken roles are easily identified, in  the third case, confusion may appear which is actually aroused by the different  manner in which tourists perceive the morphological elements. For some  tourists, elements such as Piatra Cetii, Col&#355;ii Trasc&#259;ului or the steep slopes  of the Bedeleu represent first-rank tourist objectives, while, for others, they  are just the landscape background for other objectives or for tourist  activities whose development is not related to their presence. This role  appears more clearly in the case of a less spectacular relief, which only frames,  from the landscape viewpoint, a tourist resource of prime importance. The study  of the relief&rsquo;s role as landscape background for tourism has high importance in  the sense that in any attempt to create a hierarchy of the tourist objectives  in the Trasc&#259;u Mountains, the attractiveness coefficient of the background, of  the landscape in which the objective is an integral part, must be taken into  consideration.</p>
        <p><strong>Key words:</strong> landscape  background, tourist objective, the Trasc&#259;u   Mountains, perception,  motivation.<br />

            <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash;</strong> The geographical  space of the Land   of Lovi&#351;tea, presented as  a particular structural and functional territorial unit defines itself by means  of its components and established interactions. In this regard, the locative  fund represents a component of the habitat with an important role in the  settlement and the perpetuation of the human element (enforces the sheltering  function and preservation of the anthropic element) which imposed certain  development directions and utilization of the existing space. The geographical  distribution of the human dwellings in the Land of Lovi&#351;tea marks out a  dispersion and a dissymmetry situation so that a consolidation of the locative  fund in the depression area is identified, with favorable conditions for the  cultivation of the crops (an economy of the existing space), as well as a  diffusion in the high hilly and mountain area where the land is used in  breeding activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash; </strong>The analysis of the  main climate elements allows the characterization of the geographical area of  the T&acirc;rgovi&#351;te Plain from the climatic viewpoint (located at the contact of two  major physical-geographical units, the Sub-Carpathians and the plateau, the  T&acirc;rgovi&#351;te Plain has benefited from the natural and human resources offered by  the two units, as well as by the presence of the Ialomi&#355;a and the D&acirc;mbovi&#355;a  rivers on the margins; within the Romanian Plain, the T&acirc;rgovi&#351;te Plain has a  peripheral position, being bordered by the subsidence plain of Titu-S&#259;lcu&#355;a in  the south, south-west and south-east, and by the piedmont plain of Cricovul  Dulce). This analysis was made based on the data recorded at the weather  station of T&acirc;rgovi&#351;te (located at 228 m altitude, 44056' N latitude, 25026' E longitude) and at the weather  station of Titu (125 m altitude, 45036&rsquo; latitude N, 26025&rsquo;  longitude E) during the period between 1961 and 2007. The annual, seasonal and  monthly values of the Standardized Precipitation Anomaly (SPA) was calculated  and interpreted. </p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT </strong>&ndash; The Getic  Sub-Carpathians show permittivity from their position, altitude, valley&rsquo;s  orientation, mild climate, from the circulation and habitation favourability  viewpoint. This way, they become a space of Carpathian contiguity. The  humanization of this sector has deep roots in this space history. The fact that  they have been a good place for the development of human settlements, through  the attributes offered by the physical-geographic characteristics of the  territory, is shown by the presence of the three old settlements that took the  role of capitals: C&acirc;mpulung, Curtea de Arge&#351; and T&acirc;rgovi&#351;te. Depressions  represented the right places for the settlements&rsquo; genesis and evolution; the  valleys crossing them have been the ways for the development of communication  routs; the Sub-Carpathian heights offered some of the pastures necessary for  animal feeding; they also played the role of shelter against the natural (e.g.  the attenuation of cold air masses) and human factors. <br />
