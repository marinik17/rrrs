        ABSTRACT  - The study proposes an integrated  approach of polycentricism based on assessing the issues of the Romanian urban  and rural spaces. The first step was the definition of a few evaluation indices  of the polycentricism level within the rural and urban areas and the  establishment of a general indicator aggregating the first ones. The analysis  made for each development region is focused, on the one hand, on the specific  component elements for defining the polycentricism level and, on the other  hand, on the possibility of covering each used indicator with official  statistical data. These indicators may be used in the development of the new  Regional Development Plan for the upcoming period of 2014-2020, based on the  Improvement Territorial Regional Plans and Metropolitan and Regional  Development Strategies.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> &ndash; Competitiveness  strategy agreed in Lisbon  in 2000 was seen as a radical change in the economic and social policy of the  European Union. However, this strategy, meant to be a response to  globalization, mass unemployment, and deindustrialization, has disappointing  results. This failure may be partly explained by the structural funds  dispersion between the traditional objective of territorial solidarity, the Lisbon imperative of  competitiveness and after 2001, sustainable development.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> - The Regional policy of the EU is pursuing the harmonious development  of the European territory; this is a necessary condition for the creation of an  environment that is favourable to the convergence of the Union&rsquo;s  policies. But, for these policies to converge, it is necessary that there are  common objectives and these can arise only from the existence of common needs.  It is obvious that a very different level of development leads to different  needs for people and territories and therefore, to the pursuit of different  objectives. The introduction of the territorial cohesion as an objective of the  European Union through the Treaty of Lisbon has concluded many years of debate  over the essence and future of the EU. But is this a prerequisite for the sustainable  development of the EU regions? To answer this question, in this paper we will  try to show the importance of the territorial cohesion in the EU. In order to  do this, we will place the evolution of this concept in parallel with that of  development and also with the process of enlargement and of deepening of the  EU. We will thus try to determine the influence that territorial cohesion has  on regions and on the European construction so that in the end we should be  able to explain the effects that it has on their sustainable development.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT - </strong>Drawing up cultural  macro-regions in Hungary  is hardly possible as not even<strong> </strong>two of the highly developed mezo-regions  are contacting, not speaking about forming a bloc; they rather constitute a  mosaic on the country map. Those on medium cultural level make up two groups,  while, though the ones with a low standard are mostly found along the Danube as  a single bloc, they are isolated by Pest county, statistically grouped in one  region with them, with a genuine cultural level far exceeding the low cluster.  Consequently, it is only justified to speak about cultural regions in the sense  that, on the whole, Dun&aacute;nt&uacute;l is on a higher standard than the eastern half of  the country.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash;</strong> The different geographical characteristics allowed the differentiation  of multiple subunits in the Some&#351; Plateau. From the 219 identified rural  settlements, 16% are commune centers and the remaining 84% are related  villages. In the assessment of the demographic vulnerability of rural  settlements, there are several criteria of which the number of inhabitants is  one of the most important. Certainly, determining the appropriate interval of  each vulnerability degree has a subjective character depending on the  characteristics of the settlements. In the Some&#351; Plateau, four degrees of  demographic vulnerability were differenced according to the number of  inhabitants: low (over 1000 inhabitants), medium (501-1000 inhabitants), high  (between 101 and 500 inhabitants) and extreme (below 100 inhabitants). A common  feature in all geographic subdivisions is that the share of settlements with  high vulnerability is the largest. </p>

  <strong>Examining  Neighbourhood Effects in Regional Inequalities of Hungary: a GIS-Based Approach from  Topological Relations to Neighbourhood Heterogeneity</strong><br />

            <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash;</strong> There is an  increasing number of popular works, which explain regional inequalities of the  economy and the society with spatial location. Techniques like spatial  autocorrelation or spatial clustering became basic methods of mainstream  examinations. These methods put geographical location, or more precisely the  neighbourhood effects, in the focus of the researches. The typical research  questions originate from Waldo Tobler&rsquo;s classical law of geography, namely that  &ldquo;everything is related to everything else, but closer things are more closely  related&rdquo;. According to the research assumptions, the regions that are  neighbours in geographical space are usually similar to each other also in  socio-economic sense. For the examination of neighbourhood effects, GIS  (Geographical Information Systems) may serve as a quite useful tool. By the  application of GIS programmes, the topological relation of the examined objects  can be straightforwardly defined. Additionally results of examinations with  different methodological approach can be also easily compared. This paper, on  the one hand, introduces both different methods of defining neighbourhood relations  and the application of GIS in determining contiguity. On the other hand, it  reflects how varied or same consequences can be drawn by the application of  these techniques. In the analysis of neighbourhood effects, the most  deterministic factors of the Hungarian regional inequalities are examined: the  level of personal income and the unemployment rate. The examination points out  where stable social and regional clusters were formed in Hungary, in the  mirror of the different methodological approaches.&nbsp; </p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> &ndash; The most  important right bank tributary of the Putna River in the Land of Vrancea, the  Z&#259;bala River, springs from the main orographic node of the Vrancea Mountains  and crosses the mountain area to create, at the contact between the mountains  and the Sub-Carpathian region, a depression area which represented the  habitational and economic support for the formation of the Land of Vrancea. One  of the main economic activities developed within the Z&#259;bala River basin  is agriculture, a traditional occupation and at the same time a possible basis  for a sustainable development. In the current paper, we have made an analysis  of the main parameters which influence the practice of agriculture, as well as  of the possibilities for the development of other agricultural activities  depending on the characteristics of the available land fund, on the  technological facilities and on the existing human resource by taking into  consideration the structure and characteristics of the two current branches of  the primary sector of activity.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash;</strong> The policy of the  disadvantaged areas was a component of the regional development policy in Romania between  1998 and 2010. It aimed to delineate those areas that underwent serious  economic and social issues that were mainly generated by industrial  restructuring in order to take specific measures to revive them. Baia Mare  mining area is one of the 38 disadvantaged areas that were identified in Romania. The  present article aims to emphasize the results of such a policy within Baia Mare  mining area, the way in which the status of disadvantaged area had effects on  the economic development of the city of Baia    Mare and on the other localities included. Therefore,  the companies that invested in the area once it was declared a &ldquo;disadvantaged  area&rdquo; were analyzed, along with the new jobs, the facilities for companies, the  total value of investments and the way these influenced (in a positive or  negative manner) the decrease in the unemployment rate and the economic revival  through activities from new economic domains. The conclusion is that a high number  of companies had investments during its existence as a disadvantaged area, yet  the effects they had on the economic development are evident particularly in  the city of Baia Mare.  The poor quality of the transport infrastructure and of the business infrastructure  restricts the economic potential of the other localities that are part of the  area, therefore they registered few investments.</p>

  <strong>Impact of  Industrial Restructuring on Population Dynamics in the City of C&#259;l&#259;ra&#351;i</strong><br />

            <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> - The present paper focuses on a geographical study on industrial  restructuring of the C&#259;l&#259;ra&#351;i city, in terms of economic and human potential.  To develop this working paper, the physical-geographical aspects of the region  were taken into account, mainly economic, social and demographic analyzing the  main features of each component. Industrial restructuring phenomenon has been  studied in the literature of recent years, especially in the context of a  global orientation direction towards tertiary sectors, and regional crises. In  this sense, by the process of industrial restructuring in the city of C&#259;l&#259;ra&#351;i  one can understand a decrease in occupancy rates in industry as a percentage of  total employees. It is therefore possible to argue that the decrease in the  number of employees in industry can simply reflect the share of the industry  sector in GDP. Furthermore, the paper analyzes the state of industry in  C&#259;l&#259;ra&#351;i before and after 1989. The industrialization before 1989 had a strong  impact on population, in the idea that the evolution of population had a  significant boost due to the permanent migration of a significant part of rural  population to urban areas. The industry of C&#259;l&#259;ra&#351;i after 1989 did not register  a positive trend, the Romanian revolution signifying the &quot;beginning of the  end&quot; for most of the powerful industrial units of the city. However, there  is an excellent infrastructure for industrial development in C&#259;l&#259;ra&#351;i. The  analysis showed that C&#259;l&#259;ra&#351;i is currently a centre polarizing all fields of  activity, its attractiveness exceeding its area of direct influence.  Nevertheless, due to its location close to the border with Bulgaria, the city  of C&#259;l&#259;ra&#351;i can be characterized as a multi-functional contact centre -  &quot;the gate of Romania to the South-East.&quot; It is hard to predict, in  the current conditions, the future of the city of C&#259;l&#259;ra&#351;i in terms of economic  development.</p>

  <strong>Forecast the Impact of Bucharest  &ndash; Bra&#351;ov Highway  on the Economic and Functional Structure of Human Settlements in Ilfov County</strong><br />

            <strong>ABSTRACT - </strong>One of the most  publicized issues concerning the infrastructure of Romania is the Bucharest-Bra&#351;ov  highway. The long-awaited project aims to streamline the traffic between the  Capital and the central part of the country, representing the central area of  the Pan - European Road Corridor IV. The length of the highway on the territory of Ilfov County is 31 km, representing 17%  of the total length of Bucharest- Bra&#351;ov highway. The start of the highway will  have strong effects on economic structure and on the way the Bucharest  Metropolitan Area will work. We can expect an increase in the disparities  between the settlements of Ilfov   County. This pattern is  also observable on the Bucharest-Ploie&#351;ti corridor where, in recent years, much  of the Ilfov county's economic activities have migrated to the north,  especially along that corridor. Besides economic migration, intense residential  migration followed the Bucharest &ndash; Ploie&#351;ti corridor, residents of the Bucharest  itself moving out to the north of Ilfov   County. Probably, the  future Bucharest &ndash; Bra&#351;ov highway will lead to an increased  suburbanization and periurbanization, this in turn giving way to the crowding  of the area by businesses eager to have access to the highway. This project  will likely increase the gap between north and south of Ilfov County.  In addition to changes that may occur at the county level, changes will also  have an impact on the localities themselves since the areas located near the  highway will have an economic and demographic growth rate superior to more  remote areas. In this sense, we conducted a comparative analysis between eight  settlements of Ilfov county crossed by the Bucharest-Bra&#351;ov highway in order to  assess the impact. This analysis was based on the information obtained from  site and statistical indicators that were processed to obtain a clear picture  of the situation in the examined territory. </p>

            <strong>Abstract  - </strong>The  European rural policy is shifting from the concept of multifunctionality to the  one of public good with a growing attention to environmental concerns and green  livelihoods. In Maramure&#351;, Romania, this approach is only  partially explored: as diversification strategy, several tourist accommodation  facilities have been created by rural households, but those services are often  not integrated to territorial amenities. Consequently, the rural system is  still agriculturally based with a largely unexplored potential considering  non-farm activities, a high migration rate, and a consistent land abandonment.  The research aims to investigate how tourist initiatives can contribute to the  promotion of green livelihoods through the valorization of local assets.  Tourism can foster the enhancement of the territorial capital (natural,  cultural social, institutional and economic ones), the preservation of public  goods in the area (i.e. forests, land management) and the promotion of a more  environmental oriented livelihood. A development strategy based on the  recognition of the specificity embedded in the territorial capital can move the  traditional heritage and local assets back to the core of the policy debate, recognizing  their role in the socio-economic and environmental development of the area.  Methodologically, the work is based on a cluster analysis carried out trough  data collected from a range of rural guesthouses (offering tourist  accommodation facilities) and focusing on the concept of public good and on the  local strategies adopted to manage and valorize the territorial capital.  Collected data served as main tool for the identification of the major  challenges that local administration should overcome to identify an effective  strategy for local development. Moreover, the cluster analysis has been  anticipated by an extensive literature review conducted on the existing policy  papers, reports and documents focused on the promotion of sustainable  development in rural Romania.</p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash;</strong> The development  and the diversification of the economy in the Land of Severin,  especially in the rural space, depend on the level of education, knowledge and  skill. Though the improvement and the maintenance of an adequate level of basic  infrastructure is an important element in the social-economic development,  education and the professional formation are the &ldquo;engine&rdquo; for a good  development. The difficulties faced by the educational system are mainly  generated by the lack of material and human resources, which negatively  influenced the level of education and the distribution of educational services  within the two areas, urban and rural. <br />
          Education and formation are essential for the human community living in  the Land of Severin, but regarding the scholar infrastructure, there are  evident discrepancies between the rural and urban space: the quality of  education is low, on the one hand because of the poor endowment of educational  infrastructure and, on the other hand, due to the teachers&rsquo; level of  experience/ skill. Another problem faced by the system of educational services  is the difficulty to attract skilled personnel in rural areas.<br />

  <strong>Inventory Cards for  Regionally Relevant Geomorphosites</strong><br />

        <p><a href="Artpdf/v7n12011/RRRS71201113.pdf">[Full  text]</a><br />
            <strong>ABSTRACT &ndash;</strong> When analyzing  inventory or evaluation cards for geomorphosites, one can notice that sometimes  the elaboration of such cards is not supported by an articulated method of  inventory and assessment, whereas some cards developed together with such  methods do not in fact take up the criteria used in the assessment. In  addition, not all methods used contain such cards. Thus, we identified the need  for a new method of assessment that materializes in the development of a  synthetic sheet that captures the criteria and rates noted in the evaluative  process. The originality of the method emerges from de separation of the  structural and functional values of geomorphosites, for which new or improved  criteria and ranking are used. The restrictive attributes are also evaluated,  in order to obtain a complete view upon the possibilities of conservation and  exploitation of the geomorphosite. All scores obtained by a geomorphosite will  be reflected in the inventory card. This card will also include general  information about the landform, a brief description of the type of geomorphosite  and justification for rates given in the evaluative process. </p>

            <strong>ABSTRACT  - </strong>In order to ensure the increased efficiency of  European policies and the implementation of Structural Funds in a more balanced  manner in the different territories of the country, a number of eight  development regions have been established in Romania, corresponding to NUTS II  level. In between these regions, as well as within each of them, a major  concern is the diminution of economic and social disparities. Moreover, these  disparities can manifest themselves in a cross-border context, jumping the  administrative boundaries of regions and even neighbouring countries. In this  sense, development plans provide certain measures in order to stimulate a more  balanced development of the territories, using spatial planning as the actual  support in identifying factors that lead to the emergence and intensifying of  regional disparities. The present paper focuses on these aspects related to  spatial planning data in the context of the recent European initiatives,  through the activities of the <em>Plan4all</em> project that is being implemented by a European consortium. Romania is  partner in this project and is represented by the North-West Regional  Development Agency (North-West RDA). The paper presents the achievements of the  running <em>Plan4all</em> project until the  present day, as well as the involvement and the contributions of the North-West  RDA so far.</p>
